# Utility Network — Project Brief (Living Doc)

**Goal:** Hands-off AdSense income (Auto ads) with ≤ 1 hr/month maintenance.
- **GA4:** G-083MSQKPFX (shared across all sites initially)
- **AdSense Publisher:** ca-pub-6175161566333696
- **Network:** 10 micro-sites + umbrella landing; cross-site bar pulls from `/shared/assets/network.json`.

**Prioritized launch:** Home Projects → Party Planner → Cooking Core → Travel Cost → Work & Money → Templates → Holiday Minis → Sports Helpers → Home Energy → Dog-Friendly.

**Non-YMYL stance:** All calculators are “estimates” + FAQ helpers; include disclaimers. Favor fast CWV, a11y, minimal CLS.

**90-Day outline (per site):**
- **Days 1–7:** Titles/H1/meta, JSON-LD (FAQ/HowTo), GA4 + AdSense, robots/sitemap/ads.txt, internal links.
- **Days 8–30:** Ship 1–2 long-tail templates. Add 3 PAA-style FAQs/page. Start indexing.
- **Days 31–60:** Expand safe programmatic variants (avoid thin pages). Begin Auto-ads toggle tests (anchors/vignette).
- **Days 61–90:** Scale best templates, prune weak ones, tighten CWV & UX based on GA4 events.
