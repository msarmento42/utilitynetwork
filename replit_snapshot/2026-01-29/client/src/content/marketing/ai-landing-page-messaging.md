## Use Case

**Improving Landing Page Copy with AI:** This article is for marketers looking to enhance the text on a landing page to better persuade visitors to take action (sign up, purchase, request info, etc.).

The use case could be a small business owner with a DIY website or a marketer without a dedicated copywriter. AI can act as a copywriting assistant to generate compelling headlines, value propositions, and calls-to-action based on your product/service benefits.

For example, if you have a landing page for a free e-book download, AI can help come up with a more attention-grabbing headline and a clearer description of the e-book's value, potentially increasing conversion rate (the percentage of visitors who fill the form).

This process isn't about redesigning the page layout, but specifically optimizing the messaging and wording to align with user needs and reduce friction. It's especially useful if your current landing page has a high bounce rate or low conversion — signs that the messaging might not be resonating or clearly conveying value.

## Requirements

- **AI Writing Tool:** A tool like ChatGPT or Claude (GPT-4 is preferred for nuanced copy; it handles persuasive tone well). Access to this tool to generate and refine copy options.

- **Your Existing Landing Page Content:** Either the live URL or the text copy (headlines, subheadings, bullet points, etc.) that's currently on the page. This allows you to feed context to the AI and compare new ideas against the original.

- **Clarity on Unique Value Proposition (UVP):** Before using AI, you should know the key benefit of your offering. E.g., "Our project management software saves teams 5 hours a week" or "This meal kit is the cheapest per serving." AI will work best if you supply these value points.

- **Conversion Goal Definition:** Know what action you want visitors to take on the landing page (fill a form, click "Buy Now," call you, etc.). Also know your audience – messaging should be tailored to their interests or pain points.

- **Analytics or User Feedback (optional):** If you have data on how the page is performing (e.g., low conversion on a certain section, or feedback like "I wasn't sure what you offer at first"), have that on hand. It can guide what needs improvement.

- **A/B Testing Tool or Plan:** After updating copy, you'll ideally run an A/B test to measure impact. Tools like Google Optimize or another testing method to show variant A vs B is important for validation.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Audit Your Current Messaging

Before jumping to AI, quickly audit your landing page. Identify the key sections of text:
- Headline
- Sub-headline
- Body or bullet points
- Call-to-action (CTA) text
- Testimonial or product description sections

Note which ones you suspect are weak. For example, maybe the headline is vague ("Welcome to Our Site") – clearly not ideal, because it doesn't say what you do or why the visitor should care.

Jot down what each section's purpose is (headline should grab attention and convey the main benefit, CTA button should spur action, etc.).

### Step 2: Gather Your Value Points and Audience Pain Points

Write a small brief that you'll give to the AI. Include:
- What the product/service is
- Who it's for
- What problem it solves
- Key benefits
- Any tone guidelines (e.g., professional vs casual, bold vs friendly)
- Specific language you want to use or avoid

**Example brief:** "Product: Cloud backup service. Audience: small business owners not tech-savvy. Problem: fear of losing data. Benefit: automatic backup, set-and-forget, affordable. Tone: reassuring and straightforward."

### Step 3: Use AI to Propose Headline Options

Start with the headline since it's critical.

**Example prompt:** "I have a landing page for [product] aimed at [audience]. The main benefit is [benefit]. Suggest 5 compelling one-line headlines (max ~10 words) that highlight this benefit in a clear, attention-grabbing way."

The AI will generate options. For example, for the backup service scenario, it might produce "Never Lose Your Business Data Again" or "Automatic Cloud Backups – Peace of Mind for SMBs."

Get a variety and pick 1-2 that hit the mark (or combine phrasing from multiple). Remember: an effective headline usually stresses a clear benefit or unique offer.

### Step 4: Tackle Sub-headline or Intro Text

Right below the headline, many pages have a sub-head or short paragraph elaborating the offer.

Use AI to refine this too. If you currently have one that's not working, provide it to AI:

**Example prompt:** "The current sub-headline is: '{current text}'. Improve this to better emphasize {specific value} and drive the reader toward action. Aim for one sentence (~15 words)."

Or if you don't have one, ask AI to craft it: "Provide a supporting sentence that follows the headline focusing on why it's important/urgent."

### Step 5: Bullet Points / Feature List Optimization

Many landing pages list features or benefits in bullets. If you have these, you can list them for the AI and ask it to rewrite in a punchier or clearer way.

**Example prompt:** "Here are 3 benefits: 1) 24/7 Monitoring, 2) One-click restore, 3) Affordable plans. Write a bulleted list framing these as customer benefits."

AI might turn that into:
- **Constant Protection:** Our system monitors your backups 24/7 so you don't have to worry.
- **One-Click Recovery:** If disaster strikes, restore all your files with a single click – stress-free.
- **Budget-Friendly:** Protect your data for less than the cost of a daily coffee.

This reframes features as benefits, which is key for conversion copy.

### Step 6: Call-to-Action (CTA) Text

Don't forget the text on your buttons or forms. Instead of a generic "Submit" or "Learn More," strong CTAs use action language and remind of the benefit.

**Example prompt:** "Suggest 5 variations for a call-to-action button text for [the offer]. It should start with a verb and encourage immediate action, e.g., 'Start...' 'Get...' etc."

You might get ideas like "Start Protecting My Data," "Get My Free Backup Trial," etc. Choose one that fits your space and tone.

### Step 7: Address Objections or Questions

Often, adding a line or two addressing common doubts can improve conversions (like a reassurance or a guarantee). For example, a small FAQ section or a tagline like "No credit card required" or "Cancel anytime" if that's relevant.

Identify a major concern your audience has (AI can even help by listing potential objections if you ask). Then, ensure your copy counters it.

**Example prompt:** "What might a customer worry about with this service? Provide a reassuring statement I can add."

Use that insight to tweak your content (maybe as a sub-point or a quick blurb near the CTA).

### Step 8: Test Variations (A/B Testing)

With new copy in hand (headline, sub-head, CTA, etc.), implement an A/B test on your landing page if possible.

- **Version A:** Original copy
- **Version B:** AI-enhanced copy

Run traffic to both (split evenly) and track conversion metrics (form submissions, clicks, etc.). Tools like Google Optimize or Optimizely can do this, or even manual split via ad campaigns if needed.

Measure which performs better. For example, maybe the AI-generated headline and CTA increase form sign-ups by 15%. That's a win – you'd then fully adopt the new copy.

### Step 9: Iterate Based on Results

If the test shows improvement, great – you've validated the AI's suggestion. If results are flat or worse, analyze why.

Perhaps the new headline was clear but less emotionally stirring. You can then try a hybrid: maybe keep the original's emotional word but include the clarity of the AI version.

**Example prompt:** "My test showed a slight drop. Possibly the headline lost urgency. Can you add a sense of urgency or strong adjective to this headline: '{AI_headline}'?"

Continue this refine-and-test cycle. Often, conversion optimization is iterative.

### Step 10: Fine-Tune Tone and Style

Ensure the final chosen copy flows well together. Sometimes AI suggestions in isolation are good, but on the page they need slight connecting tweaks.

Read the entire page top to bottom with the new text: does it tell a coherent story? Does it speak to the visitor directly (using "you")? Edit phrasing if needed for consistency.

Also proofread – AI is usually fine with grammar, but double-check punctuation and any numeric claims.

### Step 11: Leverage AI for Related Elements

Note that landing page "messaging" isn't just text paragraphs. You can use the improved copy to inform visuals and layout.

For instance, an AI-generated tagline might inspire a hero image choice (if tagline says "Save time", maybe use an image of a happy person with a clock).

You can even ask AI for suggestions on what kind of imagery would complement the new copy. The key is that with stronger messaging, all elements of the page should align to that message for maximum impact.

## Prompt Pack

### 1. Headline Brainstorm Prompt

**Purpose:** Generate clear, benefit-focused headlines

```
I need a compelling landing page headline for a [product/service] that [briefly describe main benefit]. Target audience is [audience]. Give 5 options under 10 words, each hitting on a key benefit or pain point.
```

**Variables:**
- `[product/service]` – e.g., "cloud backup solution"
- Main benefit description – e.g., "automatically protects business data 24/7"
- `[audience]` – e.g., "small business owners"

**Good output looks like:** Five punchy headlines like "Automatic Data Backup – Never Lose a File Again", "Secure Your Business Data 24/7, Hassle-Free", etc., each short and impactful.

### 2. Value Proposition/Sub-head Prompt

**Purpose:** Craft a supporting sub-headline or summary

```
Here are details about my offering: [key points]. Now write a one-sentence sub-headline (15-20 words) for the landing page that emphasizes why this solution is valuable, in a persuasive tone.
```

**Variables:**
- `[key points]` – list things like problem it solves, uniqueness, maybe an impressive stat

**Good output looks like:** A sentence like "Never worry about data loss – our system automatically secures your files, giving you peace of mind every day." It should flow from the headline and entice the reader to continue.

### 3. Bullet Point Enhancement Prompt

**Purpose:** Turn features into benefit bullets

```
I have these features: [feature list]. Turn them into 3-4 bullet points that highlight the benefit of each feature to the user. Keep each bullet to one sentence and use persuasive language.
```

**Variables:**
- `[feature list]` – e.g., "256-bit encryption, daily email reports, scalable storage"

**Good output looks like:** Bullets that say what that means for the user, e.g., "Bank-Level Security: 256-bit encryption safeguards your backups – your data stays for your eyes only."

### 4. CTA Text Prompt

**Purpose:** Find a better call-to-action

```
Suggest 5 call-to-action button texts for [the offer]. It should start with a verb and create a sense of benefit or urgency. E.g., 'Get...', 'Start...', 'Claim...' something.
```

**Variables:**
- `[the offer]` – e.g., "a free trial", "my 50% off deal", "your data protection"

**Good output looks like:** Options like "Start My Free Trial", "Protect My Data Now", "Get My Discount", etc., so you can pick the one that fits best.

### 5. Objection Handling Prompt

**Purpose:** Address a common concern succinctly

```
A potential customer might be hesitant because [insert a common fear or doubt]. Write a short reassuring statement or tagline (10-15 words) I can include on the page to counter that concern.
```

**Variables:**
- Insert a known objection, like "they think setup is hard" or "they worry about cost or commitment"

**Good output looks like:** If the concern was setup difficulty: "Setup in 5 minutes – no technical expertise required, we guide you step by step." If it was cost: "Affordable plans with no long-term contract – upgrade, downgrade, or cancel anytime."

## Example Output

Suppose we have a landing page for an online coding bootcamp aimed at working professionals looking to switch careers. The current headline is "Learn to Code" (too generic) and the sub-text is empty. We want something stronger.

**User Prompt:**
```
We offer a 12-week online coding bootcamp that helps working professionals transition to a tech career. Main benefits: learn practical skills, get mentorship, build a job-ready portfolio. Current headline 'Learn to Code' is weak. Give me 5 better headline options under 8 words that hit the career-change benefit.
```

**AI Response (example):**

> 1. "Code Your Way to a New Career"
> 2. "Launch Your Tech Career in 12 Weeks"
> 3. "From 9‑5 to Developer in 3 Months"
> 4. "Don't Just Code – Career Switch to Tech"
> 5. "Future-Proof Your Career with Code Skills"

**Analysis:** These suggestions each have a distinct angle:
- #1 is motivational
- #2 is very straightforward with timeline
- #3 uses a before/after concept (might resonate by acknowledging their current 9-5 job)
- #4 has a slight attitude and contrast
- #5 stresses future-proofing

As the marketer, you might really like #2 ("Launch Your Tech Career in 12 Weeks") because it's clear and time-bound, plus uses the word "launch" (action/exciting).

You might pair it with a sub-head like: "Online coding bootcamp designed for busy professionals. Gain real-world skills, mentorship, and a portfolio to land a developer job."

**Follow-up prompt for sub-head:**
```
Draft a sub-headline (~20 words) for the chosen headline 'Launch Your Tech Career in 12 Weeks' that highlights mentorship and portfolio, in a motivating tone.
```

**AI Response (example):**
> "Zero to job-ready in 3 months – get 1:1 mentor support and build a portfolio that employers love."

That's pretty solid. You might tweak "3 months" to "12 weeks" for consistency. Now you'd A/B test "Learn to Code" (original) vs "Launch Your Tech Career in 12 Weeks" + sub-head combo and see which drives more clicks or form fills.

## Common Mistakes

### Overloading the Page with AI Content
One mistake is replacing all text with long AI-generated paragraphs. Landing pages work best with concise, scannable text (headlines, bullets). If you let AI ramble, you might end up with too much copy that actually reduces clarity. Use AI primarily to sharpen and shorten messages, not to add fluff.

### Losing Originality or Voice
AI tends to produce "generic marketing speak" if not guided well. Phrases like "cutting-edge solutions" or "revolutionize your workflow" sound cliché and may not connect with your audience. Ensure the final copy feels human and specific to you.

### Not Fact-Checking or Verifying AI Suggestions
If you ask AI for a stat or some social proof snippet ("trusted by 1000+ users worldwide!"), it might fabricate or assume. Always verify any factual claims or numbers. If you don't have a solid number, either omit it or actually count/estimate and ensure it's truthful.

### Forgetting Mobile View and Design Considerations
Sometimes AI outputs a bit more text than fits nicely in a button or a hero section. A headline that's much longer might break awkwardly on small screens, or a button text could overflow. Always integrate the copy and test the page layout on different devices.

### Changing Too Many Elements at Once
If you revise headline, subhead, bullets, and CTA all simultaneously and see improvement (or decline), you may not know which change caused it. It's better to change a few related things (like headline+subhead together) and test, rather than a wholesale rewrite of everything at once.

### Not Considering the Whole Journey
A landing page often isn't in isolation – it's linked to an ad or email that brought the visitor there. If your Google ad said "affordable cloud backup" but the landing headline now says "Enterprise-Grade Security Backup," there's a mismatch. Make sure your new messaging aligns with upstream messaging.

### Using AI Copy that Sounds "Too Good to be True"
If AI gets hyperbolic ("Save 10 hours every day!") or makes very bold promises, dial it back. Overpromising can boost conversions short-term but lead to dissatisfaction or disbelief. Keep claims realistic and honest.

## FAQ

**Q1: My landing page has a low conversion rate. How do I know if the problem is the copy vs. something else (like design or targeting)?**

Copy is often the culprit when visitors scroll or read but don't convert. If people leave almost immediately (high bounce rate), it could be design, slow load times, or a mismatch with the ad that brought them there. You can use heatmaps or session recordings to see where people drop off. If they scroll and read but don't convert, the copy likely isn't persuading them. A good test: change only the copy and measure. If conversions improve, it was the copy. If they don't, investigate other factors.

**Q2: Can I just let AI rewrite my entire landing page and use it as-is?**

We don't recommend that approach. AI doesn't know your brand voice, your actual customers, or subtle nuances of your product. It's best to use AI for generating options and ideas, then curate and edit them. A human should always review for accuracy (make sure no false claims sneak in) and tone (make sure it sounds like you, not generic marketing-speak). Think of AI as a brainstorming partner and first-draft helper, not a finished-product machine.

**Q3: I don't have an A/B testing tool. How can I test if the new copy is better?**

If you can't run a formal A/B test, consider a time-based comparison: run your original for a period (say, 2 weeks) tracking conversions, then switch to the new copy and track for the same period. It's not as rigorous, but you can still gauge if there's a noticeable change. Alternatively, split traffic manually if using paid ads – send half your ad spend to the original page and half to a new version. Or, use Google Optimize (free tool) which allows basic split tests even without coding.

**Q4: How often should I refresh or test new landing page copy?**

There's no fixed rule, but if your conversion rate starts to plateau or decline, it's worth testing new copy. Similarly, if you launch a new product feature, run a seasonal campaign, or notice user feedback pointing to confusion, refresh the messaging accordingly. Some marketers test small copy tweaks quarterly. The key is not to set-and-forget – continuous improvement yields the best results.

**Q5: What if I'm not sure what the main benefit or value proposition is?**

Talk to your customers or read reviews. What do they say they like? What problem did your product solve for them? You can also ask AI for help: describe what you offer and ask, "What is the most compelling benefit for the target customer?" The AI might suggest a few angles. However, verify with real customer insights. Sometimes the benefit you think is primary isn't what actually convinces people. Once you identify the real value, center your headline and page around it.
