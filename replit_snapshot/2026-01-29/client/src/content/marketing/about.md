## Our Mission

*AI for Marketing* exists to help solo founders, small business marketers, and non-technical operators leverage AI in their everyday marketing tasks — without the hype, complexity, or unrealistic promises.

We believe AI is a powerful assistant, not a replacement for human judgment. Our goal is to provide clear, actionable workflows that you can implement immediately, regardless of your technical background.

## Who We Serve

We focus on three primary audiences:

**Solo Entrepreneurs & Founders** – You're running your own business and handling marketing yourself. You need to maximize impact with minimal resources. Our guides help you use AI to improve ads, content, and customer outreach without hiring specialists.

**Small Business Marketers** – You wear multiple hats: social media, email, SEO, ads. You seek efficient ways to plan and execute campaigns. We cut through the AI hype to give you no-nonsense guidance on practical uses.

**Non-Technical Marketing Operators** – You're in marketing operations or sales support, handling data and processes without coding skills. We help you streamline tasks like generating reports, managing leads, and ensuring tracking consistency.

## Our Editorial Approach

### Experience-Based Content

All content is created by practitioners who have used these workflows in real marketing scenarios. We include example outputs, common mistakes we've encountered, and lessons learned from actual implementation.

### Transparency About AI Usage

We use AI tools as part of our content creation process — for brainstorming, drafting, and exploring approaches. However, every piece of content is:

- Reviewed and edited by humans
- Fact-checked against authoritative sources
- Refined to match our authentic voice
- Never published as raw AI output

We believe in being upfront about how we use AI. It's a tool in our toolkit, not a replacement for human creativity and judgment.

### Authoritative Sources

When we make factual claims or cite statistics, we reference official documentation and reputable sources. This includes:

- Official platform documentation (Google Ads Help, Meta Business Help, etc.)
- Recognized industry studies and research
- Major marketing publications and SaaS company blogs

We avoid unverified claims and clearly mark any information that may change over time.

### Regular Updates

Marketing tools and best practices evolve quickly. All articles display a "Last updated" date, and we periodically review content to ensure accuracy. When platforms change their policies or new best practices emerge, we update our guides and note the changes.

## What We Don't Do

We have clear boundaries to maintain quality and trust:

- **No plagiarism** – All content is original or properly attributed
- **No clickbait** – Titles and content reflect reality, not sensational claims
- **No unverified promises** – We don't claim "10x your sales overnight"
- **No tool shilling** – We present tools objectively without hidden affiliations
- **No thin content** – Every article provides substantive, actionable guidance
- **No fake credentials** – We're honest about our experience level

## Our Content Clusters

We organize marketing AI content into topic areas that cover the full marketing lifecycle:

- **Ads** – Google, Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn campaign assistance
- **SEO** – Keyword research, content briefs, on-page optimization
- **Email/CRM** – Subject lines, personalization, automation

Our commitment is to provide reliable, practical content that helps you work smarter with AI — not harder.
