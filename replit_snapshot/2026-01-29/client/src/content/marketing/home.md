## Start Here

Welcome to *AI for Marketing* — your practical guide to using AI in everyday marketing tasks. This section is built for solo founders, small business marketers, and non-technical operators who want to leverage AI without the hype or complexity.

Unlike generic AI blogs or overly academic resources, we focus on **step-by-step workflows** that solve real marketing problems in plain language. Each article targets specific use cases with clear instructions, so you can immediately see how AI tools apply to your work.

### Available Workflow Guides

### Who This Is For

2. **Small Business Marketers** – Wearing multiple hats (social media, email, SEO, ads)? Find efficient ways to plan and execute campaigns without the overwhelm.

3. **Non-Technical Marketing Operators** – Not a coder but handling lots of data and processes? Learn to streamline tasks using AI tools without programming skills.

## How We Approach AI in Marketing

We position AI as an accessible "assistant" to boost your productivity, not a magic bullet. Here's our approach:

- **Practical over theoretical** – Every guide includes step-by-step workflows you can follow immediately
- **Tool-agnostic** – We focus on techniques that work across different AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- **Honest expectations** – We highlight both benefits and limitations of AI in marketing
- **Human oversight required** – AI generates options; you make the final decisions

All content on this site is reviewed, edited, and fact-checked by humans before publication. We never publish raw AI output. When we cite statistics or make factual claims, we provide sources. Our goal is to help you work smarter, not to overpromise results.
