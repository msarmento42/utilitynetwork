# How to Use AI to Find Flights and Accommodations

## What You'll Accomplish

This workflow shows you how to use AI to research and compare flights and accommodations before booking. AI can suggest optimal routes, help you understand pricing patterns, and recommend neighborhoods and lodging types that fit your needs.

## Who This Is For

This is helpful if:
- You're overwhelmed by booking options
- You want to understand the best time to book or travel
- You need help comparing options across different criteria
- You're looking for insider tips on where to stay

## Inputs You Need

- **Origin and destination:** Where are you flying from and to?
- **Dates (or flexibility):** Specific dates or "sometime in March"?
- **Budget:** How much can you spend on flights/hotels?
- **Preferences:** Direct flights only? Hotel vs. Airbnb? Central location vs. quiet?
- **Number of travelers:** Solo, couple, family, group?

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Ask AI About Flight Options
"I'm flying from Boston to Barcelona in June for a week. What are typically the cheapest days to fly? Any tips for finding good deals?"

### Step 2: Get Routing Suggestions
"Are direct flights available from Boston to Barcelona? If not, what are the best connection cities?"

### Step 3: Understand Pricing Patterns
"When should I book flights to Europe for the best prices? How far in advance?"

### Step 4: Ask About Accommodation Areas
"I'm staying in Barcelona for 5 nights. Which neighborhoods are best for tourists who want walkability, good food, and beach access?"

### Step 5: Compare Lodging Types
"For a family of 4 spending a week in Barcelona, is a hotel or apartment rental better value? What are the pros and cons?"

### Step 6: Get Specific Recommendations
"What should I look for in a Barcelona hotel? Any must-have amenities or red flags?"

### Step 7: Verify on Booking Sites
Take AI's guidance to actual booking platforms (Google Flights, Booking.com, Airbnb) to compare real prices.

## Prompt Templates

- "What's the **best time to book flights** from the US to Japan for cherry blossom season?"
- "Compare staying in **Rome's historic center vs. Trastevere**. Which is better for first-time visitors?"
- "I have airline miles on **United**. What's the best way to use them for a trip to South America?"
- "Should I book **hotels directly or through third-party sites**? What are the trade-offs?"

## Example Output

**Question:** "Best neighborhoods to stay in Paris for first-time visitors, mid-range budget."

**AI Response:**

**Top Picks:**

1. **Le Marais (3rd/4th arr.)** – Central, walkable, trendy shops and cafes. Near Notre-Dame and Bastille. Lively atmosphere. Can be pricey but good mid-range options exist.

2. **Saint-Germain-des-Prés (6th arr.)** – Classic Paris feel, near Luxembourg Gardens and Seine. Literary cafes, excellent restaurants. Quieter evenings.

3. **Montmartre (18th arr.)** – Bohemian vibe, near Sacré-Cœur. More affordable. Some steep hills. Slightly removed from central sights but excellent metro access.

4. **Bastille/Nation (11th/12th arr.)** – Local feel, excellent food scene, affordable. Easy metro to everywhere. Less touristy but very livable.

**Avoid for first-timers:**
- Areas near Gare du Nord (less charming, safety concerns at night)
- Very far suburbs (long commutes)

**Hotel Tips:**
- Look for hotels near a metro station for easy access
- Breakfast often not worth the extra charge – hit a local bakery instead
- Rooms are small by American standards – this is normal in Paris

## Common Mistakes

- **Only checking one booking site:** Prices vary. **Fix:** Compare across multiple platforms.
- **Ignoring location trade-offs:** Cheap hotel far from sights = expensive taxis. **Fix:** Factor in transit costs.
- **Booking refundable rates "just in case":** Often much more expensive. **Fix:** Only pay for flexibility if you truly need it.
- **Not reading reviews carefully:** **Fix:** Look at recent reviews specifically mentioning your priorities.
- **Trusting AI prices as current:** **Fix:** AI can't see real-time availability or prices. Always verify.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Compared prices across multiple booking platforms
- [ ] Considered location relative to planned activities
- [ ] Read recent reviews for chosen accommodations
- [ ] Understood cancellation policies
- [ ] Factored in all fees (resort fees, cleaning fees, taxes)
