# How to Plan a Multi-Destination Trip with AI

## What You'll Accomplish

This workflow helps you plan trips that involve multiple cities, countries, or regions. AI will help you optimize your route, allocate time wisely, and coordinate transportation between destinations. By the end, you'll have a logical, efficient multi-stop itinerary.

## Who This Is For

This is essential if:
- You're visiting multiple cities on one trip
- You're planning a road trip with many stops
- You're doing a multi-country adventure
- You need to optimize routing for time or cost

## Inputs You Need

- **All destinations:** List every place you want to visit
- **Total trip length:** How many days do you have?
- **Starting and ending points:** Same city? Open jaw flights?
- **Must-see priorities:** What's most important if time gets tight?
- **Transportation preferences:** Trains, flights, rental car, buses?
- **Flexibility:** Can you cut destinations if needed?

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: List All Desired Destinations
"I want to visit Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Prague in 2 weeks."

### Step 2: Ask AI to Suggest Routing
"What's the most logical order to visit these cities by train? What routes are fastest?"

### Step 3: Allocate Days Per Destination
"How many days should I spend in each city to see the highlights without rushing?"

### Step 4: Get Transportation Options
"What are my options for getting from Paris to Amsterdam? Compare train vs. flight in terms of time, cost, and convenience."

### Step 5: Build the Master Itinerary
"Create a day-by-day itinerary for this route, including travel days."

### Step 6: Identify Potential Cuts
"If I only have 10 days instead of 14, which city should I skip or shorten?"

### Step 7: Handle Logistics
"What advance bookings do I need? Train reservations, museum tickets, etc."

## Prompt Templates

- "Optimize this route: I'm flying into Rome, want to see Florence, Venice, and Cinque Terre, then fly out of Milan. **What order makes sense?**"
- "I have **3 weeks for Southeast Asia**. I want to see Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. How should I split my time and route it?"
- "Compare **Eurail pass vs. individual tickets** for my 4-city Europe trip."
- "Is it better to **fly or take a ferry** between Greek islands?"

## Example Output

**Question:** "Plan a 2-week trip: Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague. I arrive in Paris and leave from Prague."

**AI Response:**

**Recommended Route:**
Paris → Amsterdam → Berlin → Prague

This follows a logical west-to-east path with good transportation options.

**Suggested Time Allocation:**
- Paris: 4 days (major sights + day trip to Versailles)
- Amsterdam: 3 days (city + possible Zaanse Schans)
- Berlin: 4 days (lots to see, spread out city)
- Prague: 3 days (compact historic center)
- Total: 14 days including travel days

**Transportation:**
- Paris → Amsterdam: Thalys train, 3.5 hours, ~€40-120
- Amsterdam → Berlin: ICE train, 6 hours, ~€40-80 (or 1-hour flight)
- Berlin → Prague: Bus or train, 4-5 hours, ~€20-40

**Sample Itinerary:**
- Day 1-4: Paris
- Day 5: Train to Amsterdam (afternoon arrival, evening explore)
- Day 6-7: Amsterdam
- Day 8: Train to Berlin
- Day 9-11: Berlin
- Day 12: Train to Prague
- Day 13-14: Prague, depart

**Advance Bookings Needed:**
- Thalys Paris-Amsterdam (books up)
- Louvre tickets
- Anne Frank House (always sells out)
- Reichstag dome in Berlin (free but requires reservation)

## Common Mistakes

- **Too many destinations, too little time:** **Fix:** Be ruthless. It's better to enjoy 3 cities than rush through 6.
- **Underestimating travel days:** 4-6 hours on a train is tiring. **Fix:** Count travel as partial days.
- **Ignoring geography:** Random order wastes time. **Fix:** Always ask AI to optimize routing.
- **Not considering open-jaw flights:** Flying into one city and out of another saves backtracking. **Fix:** Price multi-city tickets.
- **Overbooking everything:** **Fix:** Leave flexibility for spontaneous discoveries.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Route follows logical geography
- [ ] Time per destination is reasonable for what you want to see
- [ ] Travel days are accounted for
- [ ] Transportation between cities is researched
- [ ] Advance reservations identified
- [ ] Flexibility built in for delays or changes

## Disclaimer

Multi-destination trips have more variables. Verify all transportation schedules, border crossing requirements, and visa situations for each country. AI routing suggestions are logical but may not account for current strikes, closures, or schedule changes. Always have backup plans.
