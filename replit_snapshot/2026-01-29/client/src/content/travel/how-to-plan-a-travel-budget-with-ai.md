# How to Plan a Travel Budget with AI

## What You'll Accomplish

This workflow helps you create a realistic travel budget with AI assistance. You'll estimate costs for flights, accommodations, food, activities, and incidentals. By the end, you'll have a clear picture of what your trip will cost and how to allocate your money wisely.

## Who This Is For

This is perfect if:
- You want to know roughly how much a trip will cost before booking
- You have a fixed budget and need to plan within it
- You want to compare costs between different destinations
- You're trying to save money by identifying where to cut costs

## Inputs You Need

- **Destination and dates:** Where and when are you going?
- **Trip length:** How many days?
- **Travel style:** Budget, mid-range, or luxury?
- **Number of travelers:** Solo, couple, family?
- **Starting location:** For flight estimates
- **Activities planned:** Tours, museums, special experiences?

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Get a High-Level Estimate
"Estimate the total cost for a 10-day trip to Portugal for 2 people from Chicago in May. Mid-range budget (not hostels, not 5-star). Include flights, hotels, food, and activities."

### Step 2: Break Down by Category
"Break down that estimate by category: flights, accommodations, food, transportation, activities, and miscellaneous."

### Step 3: Ask for Daily Expense Estimate
"What should I budget per day for food and local transportation in Lisbon and Porto?"

### Step 4: Identify Money-Saving Opportunities
"How can I reduce costs on this Portugal trip? Where can I save without sacrificing quality?"

### Step 5: Account for Hidden Costs
"What hidden costs should I budget for? Tips, tourist taxes, entrance fees, etc.?"

### Step 6: Create a Final Budget
Compile AI's information into a spreadsheet or document you can track against.

## Prompt Templates

- "Compare the cost of a **week in Bali vs. Thailand** for a budget traveler."
- "I have **$3,000 for a 2-week Europe trip**. Create a budget that makes this work."
- "What's a realistic **daily budget for Tokyo** including food, transport, and one activity?"
- "How much should I budget for **tips and gratuities in Mexico**?"

## Example Output

**10-Day Portugal Trip for 2 (Mid-Range) from Chicago**

| Category | Estimate | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Flights | $1,200 | Round-trip for 2, economy |
| Accommodation | $1,500 | $150/night average, 10 nights |
| Food | $800 | ~$40/person/day |
| Local Transport | $200 | Trains between cities, metro, Uber |
| Activities | $400 | Museum entries, tours, day trips |
| Miscellaneous | $200 | SIM card, souvenirs, tips |
| **Total** | **$4,300** | |

**Daily Breakdown:**

- Lunch: €10-15 for a casual meal
- Dinner: €20-30 for a nice restaurant
- Coffee/snacks: €5-10

**Money-Saving Tips:**
- Book flights 2-3 months in advance
- Stay in Airbnbs for kitchen access
- Eat lunch as your main meal (Portuguese "menu do dia" is cheap)
- Free walking tours in major cities (tip-based)

## Common Mistakes

- **Not accounting for currency exchange:** **Fix:** Include exchange rates and potential fees.
- **Forgetting pre-trip costs:** Visas, travel insurance, vaccines. **Fix:** Ask AI about pre-departure expenses.
- **Underestimating food costs:** **Fix:** Research actual restaurant prices in your destination.
- **Not budgeting for emergencies:** **Fix:** Add 10-15% buffer for unexpected expenses.
- **Taking AI estimates as exact:** **Fix:** Always verify with current prices on booking sites.
