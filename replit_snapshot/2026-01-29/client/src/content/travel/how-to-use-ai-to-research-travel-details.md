# How to Use AI to Research Travel Details

## What You'll Accomplish

This workflow shows you how to use AI to quickly research travel-related information – from visa requirements and local customs to safety considerations and practical details. You'll also learn how to verify AI's information against official sources.

## Who This Is For

This is helpful if:
- You're researching a new destination and need practical information
- You want quick answers about visas, weather, or customs
- You're trying to understand local etiquette before you arrive
- You need to verify travel requirements or restrictions

## Inputs You Need

- **Your destination:** Where are you traveling?
- **Your nationality/passport:** For visa and entry requirement questions
- **Specific questions:** What exactly do you need to know?
- **Travel dates:** For weather and seasonal information

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Ask Specific Questions
Instead of "Tell me about Japan," ask specific questions: "What visa do US citizens need for a 2-week tourist visit to Japan?"

### Step 2: Get Cultural and Etiquette Information
"What are the most important cultural etiquette rules I should know before visiting Japan? What might offend locals?"

### Step 3: Research Safety Considerations
"Are there any safety concerns for tourists in [destination]? Areas to avoid?"

### Step 4: Understand Practical Details
"What type of electrical outlets are used in Japan? Do I need an adapter?"
"Can I drink tap water in Morocco?"

### Step 5: Check Seasonal Information
"What's the weather like in Iceland in March? What should I pack?"

### Step 6: Verify Critical Information
For anything related to visas, entry requirements, or safety – always verify with official sources (embassy websites, government travel advisories).

## Prompt Templates

- "Do **US citizens need a visa** for [country]? How long can I stay as a tourist?"
- "What **vaccinations are recommended** before traveling to [destination]?"
- "What are the **tipping customs** in [country]?"
- "Is it safe to **travel solo as a woman** in [destination]? Any precautions?"
- "What's the **cost of living** for tourists in [city]? Is it expensive or budget-friendly?"

## Example Output

**Question:** "What should I know before visiting Morocco as an American tourist?"

**AI Response:**

**Entry Requirements:**
- US citizens get visa-free entry for up to 90 days
- Passport must be valid for 6 months beyond travel dates

**Cultural Etiquette:**
- Dress modestly, especially in medinas and religious areas (cover shoulders and knees)
- Ask permission before photographing people
- Remove shoes when entering homes or some shops
- Use right hand for greetings and eating
- Bargaining is expected in souks (markets) – offer 30-50% of initial price

**Safety:**
- Generally safe for tourists; use common sense
- Watch for petty theft in crowded areas
- Unofficial guides may approach you – politely decline if not interested
- Women may experience catcalling; traveling in pairs helps
- Stick to well-lit areas at night

**Practical Details:**
- Currency: Moroccan Dirham (MAD) – bring cash, ATMs available in cities
- Electricity: Type C/E plugs, 220V – bring adapter
- Tap water: Stick to bottled water
- Language: Arabic and French; some English in tourist areas

**Best Time to Visit:**
- Spring (March-May) or Fall (September-November) for pleasant weather
- Summer is very hot; Ramadan timing affects restaurant availability

**Verify:**
- Current entry requirements: travel.state.gov
- Health advisories: cdc.gov/travel

## Common Mistakes

- **Trusting AI for time-sensitive information:** Visa rules change. **Fix:** Always verify on official embassy/government sites.
- **Not specifying your nationality:** Requirements differ by passport. **Fix:** Always include your citizenship.
- **Asking too broadly:** "Tell me about France" gets generic answers. **Fix:** Ask specific, targeted questions.
- **Ignoring the verify step:** **Fix:** For anything official (visas, health, safety), double-check.
- **Relying on AI for real-time conditions:** AI doesn't know current events. **Fix:** Check recent news and travel advisories.

## Quality Checklist
