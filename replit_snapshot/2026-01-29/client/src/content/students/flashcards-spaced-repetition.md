# Build and Review Flashcards Using Spaced Repetition

## What You'll Accomplish

Learn how to use AI to rapidly create effective flashcards from your study materials, then apply spaced repetition principles to review them at optimal intervals for long-term retention. This workflow combines AI efficiency with proven memory science.

## Who This Is For

This guide is for students who need to memorize vocabulary, definitions, formulas, dates, or other factual information. It's especially useful for language learning, medical/law studies, standardized test prep, or any course with substantial memorization requirements.

## Inputs You Need

- Material to convert into flashcards (notes, textbook sections, vocabulary lists)
- A flashcard app that supports spaced repetition (Anki, Quizlet, RemNote, etc.)
- Commitment to regular review sessions
- Understanding of what information is worth memorizing vs. understanding conceptually

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Identify What to Memorize
Not everything needs flashcards. Focus on discrete facts: definitions, terms, formulas, dates, vocabulary. Concepts requiring deeper understanding are better studied through other methods.

### Step 2: Gather Your Source Material
Collect notes, textbook sections, or vocabulary lists containing the information you need to memorize.

### Step 3: Generate Flashcards with AI
Prompt AI to create flashcard pairs (front/back or question/answer) from your material. Specify the format and any preferences.

### Step 4: Review and Edit Cards
Go through the AI-generated flashcards. Check for accuracy, clarity, and appropriate difficulty. Edit or discard cards that are confusing or incorrect.

### Step 5: Import to Your Flashcard App
Add the cards to a spaced repetition app. Organize them into decks by subject or topic.

### Step 6: Review Daily Using Spaced Repetition
Let the app schedule your reviews. Cards you get right appear less frequently; cards you struggle with appear more often. This optimizes your review time.

### Step 7: Add New Cards as You Learn
As your course progresses, generate and add new flashcards. Keep your decks current with what you're studying.

## Prompt Templates

**Basic Term Definitions:**
"Create flashcards for these terms. Format each as 'Term: Definition' on separate lines: [paste terms or notes]"

**Vocabulary with Context:**
"Generate flashcards for these vocabulary words. Include the word on front, and definition plus an example sentence on the back: [paste word list]"

**Question-Answer Format:**
"Convert these notes into flashcard format. Create a question on the front that the note answers, and put the answer on the back: [paste notes]"

**Formulas and Equations:**
"Create flashcards for these formulas. Front should name/describe what the formula calculates; back should show the formula and key variables: [paste formulas]"

**Historical Dates/Events:**
"Make flashcards for these historical events. Front: What happened on [date]? Back: [event and significance]: [paste dates and events]"

**Cloze Deletion Style:**
"Convert this paragraph into cloze-deletion flashcards (fill-in-the-blank style) for the key terms: [paste paragraph]"

## Example Output

**Spanish Vocabulary Flashcards:**

| Front | Back |
|-------|------|
| biblioteca | library – "Voy a la biblioteca para estudiar." |
| periodico | newspaper – "Leo el periódico cada mañana." |
| ayudar | to help – "¿Me puedes ayudar con la tarea?" |

**Biology Terms:**

| Front | Back |
|-------|------|
| What is mitochondria's primary function? | To produce ATP (energy) through cellular respiration – often called "the powerhouse of the cell" |
| What does DNA stand for and what is its role? | Deoxyribonucleic acid – carries genetic information that codes for proteins and determines inherited traits |

## About Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that increases review intervals as you demonstrate mastery. Instead of cramming, you review material at scientifically-optimized intervals:
- New cards: Review daily
- Cards you know well: Review in 3 days, then 1 week, then 2 weeks, etc.
- Cards you struggle with: Review more frequently until mastered

This approach maximizes retention while minimizing study time. Apps like Anki, Quizlet, and RemNote automate this scheduling for you.

## Academic Integrity Note

Creating flashcards from your course materials is a legitimate study activity. The AI is helping you format information, not doing your learning. You still need to actually review the cards and commit the information to memory. This workflow is for personal study and exam preparation.

## Common Mistakes

- **Making cards too complex:** Each card should test one piece of information. Split complex cards.
- **Not reviewing regularly:** Spaced repetition only works with consistent daily review.
- **Creating cards without understanding:** Memorizing definitions you don't understand is ineffective.
- **Too many new cards at once:** Add cards gradually to avoid overwhelming review loads.
- **Never editing AI output:** Review and correct any errors before studying from the cards.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Cards focus on discrete, memorizable facts.
- [ ] Each card tests only one piece of information.
- [ ] AI-generated content has been reviewed for accuracy.
- [ ] Cards are imported into a spaced repetition system.
- [ ] Daily review habit is established.
- [ ] New cards are added as course progresses.

## Disclaimer

AI-generated flashcards may contain errors. Always verify accuracy against your course materials before studying. This workflow is for personal study aid, not for completing assignments. Follow your institution's academic integrity policies.
