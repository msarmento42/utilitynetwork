# AI for Students & Study

Welcome to **AI for Students & Study**, a hub of practical workflows for using artificial intelligence to support your learning. Here you'll find guides on how to **study smarter with AI** – from summarizing lecture notes to generating practice quizzes – all with an **integrity-first approach**. Our focus is helping you leverage AI as a study tool **responsibly and effectively**, so you can save time and learn more deeply without crossing ethical lines.

**Why "integrity-first"?** Because as awesome as AI can be, using it in school comes with rules. Here, we **promote learning, not cheating**. Every workflow highlights how to use AI to understand material, improve skills, or organize your work – *never to do your assignments for you*. You'll see reminders to verify AI outputs, cite sources, and follow your school's academic policies. By keeping integrity at the core, you can **confidently use AI** as an aid in your studies without worry.

**What you can do with these workflows:**

- **Clarify complex concepts:** Get AI explanations and examples to better understand tough topics.
- **Optimize study routines:** Turn notes into study guides, create flashcards, plan your study schedule, etc.
- **Improve writing drafts:** Use AI for feedback on structure and clarity (but *not* for ghostwriting).
- **Prepare for exams:** Generate practice questions, find knowledge gaps, and review effectively with AI help.

Each guide below will walk you through a specific scenario with step-by-step instructions, prompt ideas, examples, and tips to avoid common pitfalls. Whether you're studying solo or working on a group project, there's likely a workflow here that can make your academic life easier.

## Start Here – Workflow Guides

***Using these guides:*** We recommend starting with a workflow that matches your current need (e.g., prepping for an exam, writing a paper, organizing notes). Each guide is standalone, so you can dive into the one most relevant to you. As you implement these workflows, always remember to **follow your institution's academic policy**. If an assignment or instructor has specific rules about AI or collaboration, stick to those. Our guides will remind you of best practices, like double-checking AI output with your own brain and materials, and citing sources properly.

We're excited for you to explore these AI workflows and enhance your learning process. AI, when used thoughtfully, can be an amazing study partner. It can't replace the hard work *you* must do to learn and create – but it can make aspects of studying more efficient, interactive, and personalized. So jump in, and let's use AI to learn more effectively (and ethically) than ever!

*(Explore the guides below, and don't hesitate to adapt the workflows to fit your study style. Good luck, and study smart!)*
