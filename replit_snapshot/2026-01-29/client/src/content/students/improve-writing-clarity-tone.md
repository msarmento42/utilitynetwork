# Improve Your Writing (Structure, Clarity, Tone)

## What You'll Accomplish

Learn how to use AI as a writing coach to get feedback on structure, clarity, and tone in your essay drafts. This workflow helps you strengthen your arguments and polish your prose while keeping the writing authentically yours – never crossing into ghostwriting territory.

## Who This Is For

This guide is for students who want to improve their writing skills and produce stronger essays, papers, or assignments. It's useful when you've completed a draft and want feedback before submitting, or when you're struggling to make your ideas clear and compelling.

## Inputs You Need

- Your written draft (any stage – rough or polished)
- The assignment prompt or rubric
- Understanding of what kind of feedback you need (structure, clarity, grammar, argument strength)
- Openness to revising based on suggestions

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Complete Your Draft First
Always write your own draft before seeking AI feedback. The ideas, arguments, and words should come from you. AI is for refinement, not creation.

### Step 2: Identify What Needs Improvement
Before asking for feedback, consider what concerns you about your draft. Is the structure unclear? Are paragraphs too long? Is the argument weak in places?

### Step 3: Request Specific Feedback
Prompt AI to review specific aspects of your writing. Avoid vague requests like "make this better." Instead, ask about structure, clarity, argument logic, or tone.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Suggestions
Review AI feedback critically. Not all suggestions will be appropriate for your assignment, audience, or writing style. You decide what to implement.

### Step 5: Revise Yourself
Make changes in your own words. If AI suggests restructuring a paragraph, you do the restructuring. If it identifies a weak argument, you strengthen it with your own reasoning.

### Step 6: Check for Unintended Changes
After revising, read through to ensure your voice remains consistent and the content accurately reflects your understanding and ideas.

### Step 7: Proofread Final Draft
Use AI for a final grammar and spelling check if allowed by your institution. This is a common and generally accepted use.

## Prompt Templates

**Structure Feedback:**
"Review the structure of this essay. Does it have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion? Is the flow logical? Suggest improvements without rewriting: [paste essay]"

**Clarity Check:**
"Read this paragraph and identify any sentences that are unclear or confusing. Explain what's unclear and suggest how I might revise it in my own words: [paste paragraph]"

**Argument Strength:**
"Analyze the argument in this essay. Is the thesis clear? Is evidence well-connected to claims? Point out any logical gaps or weak points: [paste essay]"

**Tone Adjustment:**
"Is the tone of this essay appropriate for an academic paper? Is it too casual, too formal, or inconsistent? Give specific examples: [paste essay]"

**Paragraph Transitions:**
"Review the transitions between these paragraphs. Do they flow smoothly? Suggest transition phrases or structural changes without rewriting: [paste paragraphs]"

**Counterargument Check:**
"Does this essay adequately address potential counterarguments? If not, what counterarguments should I consider? [paste essay]"

## Example Output

**Student submits:** A paragraph about climate change policy

**AI Feedback:**
"The paragraph makes a strong claim about carbon taxes but could be improved:
1. **Clarity issue:** The second sentence is 45 words long and contains three separate ideas. Consider breaking it into 2-3 shorter sentences.
2. **Argument gap:** You state that carbon taxes reduce emissions but don't provide evidence. Consider adding a specific example or citation.
3. **Transition:** The connection between the carbon tax discussion and the following sentence about renewable energy isn't clear. A transition phrase like 'Beyond pricing mechanisms...' might help.
4. **Tone:** 'Obviously, this is the best solution' sounds too informal and assertive for academic writing. Consider 'This evidence suggests...' instead."

*(The AI points out issues but doesn't rewrite – the student must make the changes.)*

## Academic Integrity Note

There's an important line between getting feedback and having AI write for you. Acceptable uses:
- AI identifies that a paragraph is unclear; you rewrite it
- AI suggests your argument needs more evidence; you find and add evidence
- AI catches grammar errors; you correct them

Unacceptable uses:
- AI rewrites your paragraph for you
- AI generates new content for your essay
- You submit AI-revised text as if you wrote it

When in doubt, check your institution's policy on AI writing assistance. Many schools now have specific guidelines.

## Common Mistakes

- **Accepting all suggestions blindly:** AI feedback isn't always right or appropriate for your assignment.
- **Letting AI rewrite instead of guide:** Request identification of issues, not rewrites.
- **Seeking feedback before writing:** You need your own draft first. AI shouldn't generate your initial ideas.
- **Ignoring your own voice:** Over-editing based on AI can make writing sound generic.
- **Using AI when prohibited:** Some assignments explicitly forbid AI assistance. Always check.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] You wrote the draft yourself before seeking feedback.
- [ ] Feedback requested was specific (not "make it better").
- [ ] You evaluated suggestions critically before implementing.
- [ ] Revisions were made in your own words.
- [ ] Your voice and ideas remain intact.
- [ ] Final draft was proofread.

Always follow your course rubric and instructor guidance. Use AI writing assistance only where permitted by your institution's academic integrity policy.
