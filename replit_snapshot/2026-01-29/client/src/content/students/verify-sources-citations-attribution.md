# Verify Sources, Generate Citations, and Manage Attribution

## What You'll Accomplish

Learn how to use AI to support the research process: evaluating source credibility, formatting citations correctly, and ensuring proper attribution. This workflow helps you maintain academic honesty while saving time on the mechanical aspects of research.

## Who This Is For

This guide is for students writing research papers, essays, or any assignment that requires sources and citations. It's useful when you're unsure about a source's credibility, struggling with citation formats, or want to ensure you're attributing ideas properly.

## Inputs You Need

- Sources you've found (articles, books, websites)
- The required citation style (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.)
- Assignment requirements for source types and quantities
- Your notes on what information came from which source

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Find Your Sources First
AI can help evaluate sources, but you need to find them first using academic databases, library resources, and reputable search tools. Start with sources, then use AI to assess them.

### Step 2: Evaluate Source Credibility
For each source, especially websites, use AI to help assess credibility. Ask about the author's credentials, publication's reputation, and potential biases.

### Step 3: Verify Key Claims
If a source makes important factual claims, use AI to cross-reference. Ask if the claims are generally accepted, contested, or can be verified elsewhere.

### Step 4: Format Citations Correctly
Provide AI with source information and ask for a properly formatted citation in your required style. Always double-check the result.

### Step 5: Track Your Sources
Keep organized notes on which ideas came from which sources. This prevents accidental plagiarism and makes citation easier.

### Step 6: Check for Proper Attribution
Before submitting, review your paper to ensure all borrowed ideas, quotes, and paraphrases are attributed to their sources.

### Step 7: Verify AI's Citation Help
AI can make citation errors. Double-check formatting against your style guide or use your institution's citation resources.

## Prompt Templates

**Source Evaluation:**
"I found this source for my research paper: [describe source – author, publication, URL]. Can you help me evaluate its credibility? Is the author an authority? Is the publication reputable?"

**Bias Check:**
"This article argues [position]. What potential biases should I be aware of? What perspective might be missing?"

**Citation Formatting:**
"Format this source in APA 7th edition: Author: [name], Title: [title], Publication: [journal/book], Year: [year], Pages: [pages], DOI/URL: [if applicable]"

**Multiple Citation Styles:**
"Give me this citation in both MLA and APA format: [source details]"

**Paraphrase Check:**
"I wrote this paraphrase of [source author]'s idea: [your text]. Does this require a citation, and is it sufficiently in my own words?"

**Quote Integration:**
"How do I properly integrate and cite this direct quote in my paper using MLA style: [quote from source]?"

## Example Output

**Source Evaluation Request:**
"Evaluate this source: An article titled 'Climate Change Effects on Coastal Cities' by Dr. James Wilson, published in the Journal of Environmental Science in 2023."

**AI Response:**
"This appears to be a credible academic source:
- **Author:** Check if Dr. Wilson has relevant credentials (search for their institutional affiliation and other publications)
- **Publication:** Journal of Environmental Science is a peer-reviewed academic journal, which adds credibility
- **Year:** 2023 is current, which is important for rapidly evolving topics like climate science
- **To verify:** Confirm the journal is indexed in academic databases, check the author's university or research institution, and cross-reference key claims with other academic sources

*Caveat: I cannot access or verify the actual article. You should read it critically and consider how its claims align with other reputable sources.*"

**Citation Format Request:**
"Format in APA 7th: Author: Sarah Chen, Title: Digital Learning in Higher Education, Journal: Education Technology Review, Year: 2024, Volume 15, Pages: 112-128, DOI: 10.1234/etr.2024.05"

**AI Response:**
"Chen, S. (2024). Digital learning in higher education. *Education Technology Review*, *15*, 112-128. https://doi.org/10.1234/etr.2024.05

*Note: Verify DOI link works and check against your institution's APA guide for any specific requirements.*"

## Academic Integrity Note

Using AI to format citations and evaluate sources is generally acceptable – these are mechanical and analytical tasks, not the core intellectual work of your paper. However:

- **Never fabricate sources:** AI can generate plausible-sounding fake citations. Only cite sources you've actually read.
- **Always verify citations:** AI makes formatting errors. Double-check against your style guide.
- **Understand your sources:** Don't rely on AI summaries for sources you need to cite. Read them yourself.
- **Proper attribution always applies:** Whether you use AI help or not, all borrowed ideas must be credited.

## Common Mistakes

- **Trusting AI-generated citations blindly:** AI makes errors in formatting. Always verify.
- **Using AI to find sources without reading them:** You must actually read and understand your sources.
- **Fabricating sources:** Never have AI generate fake citations for sources that don't exist.
- **Forgetting AI isn't current:** AI may not have access to the latest publications or may hallucinate details.
- **Improper paraphrasing:** Changing a few words isn't paraphrasing. Understand and restate in your own words.
- **Over-relying on AI for research:** AI is a tool, not a replacement for library databases and academic research skills.

## Disclaimer

AI citation tools can contain errors. Always verify citation format against official style guides or institutional resources. AI cannot access subscription databases or verify the existence of sources – this is your responsibility. Never cite sources you haven't read. Follow your institution's policies on AI use in research.
