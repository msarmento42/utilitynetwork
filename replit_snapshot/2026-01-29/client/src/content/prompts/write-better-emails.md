# Write Better Emails

## What this pack helps you do
Use this pack to **draft, polish, or transform emails** for work or personal use. The prompts can rewrite a raw email draft to be more professional, generate subject lines, adjust tone (formal, friendly, urgent), or even draft an email from bullet points. Whether you need to apologize, request information, or announce news, these prompts guide the AI to produce clear, polite, and effective emails.

## How to use these prompts safely
Always double-check the email’s content before sending. AI-generated text can accidentally change facts or details; ensure names, dates, and plans are correct. Avoid sharing actual private content (like company secrets or personal identifiers) with the AI – use placeholders if necessary. Tailor the tone in the prompt to suit your audience. And as always, **proofread** the final email for accuracy and appropriateness before using it, since the AI may make subtle errors or misinterpret information.

## Inputs required
Provide either an initial email draft or the key information you want to convey (e.g. bullet points or a brief description). Also specify the audience and tone. For example, you might supply a draft apology email to refine, or bullet points of a project update that need to be fleshed out. Include any necessary context (relationship with recipient, formality level) in the prompt.

## Prompts

- **Rewrite for Clarity**
  - **Purpose:** Improve grammar and clarity of an email draft.
  - **Prompt:** "Rewrite this email to be clearer and more professional: \n\"[YOUR EMAIL DRAFT]\""

- **Change Tone**
  - **Purpose:** Adjust the tone of an email.
  - **Prompt:** "Change the tone of this email to be friendly but professional: \n\"[EMAIL TEXT]\""
  - **Customize:** Insert the email content and indicate the desired tone (e.g. “formal”, “cheerful”).

- **Add Formal Subject**
  - **Purpose:** Generate a suitable subject line.
  - **Prompt:** "Write a concise, professional subject line for this email: \n\"[EMAIL BODY]\""
  - **Customize:** Replace `[EMAIL BODY]` with the main message or full email text.

- **Draft from Points**
  - **Purpose:** Create an email from bullet points.
  - **Prompt:** "Compose an email using these bullet points: [BULLET POINTS LIST]"
  - **Customize:** Provide bullet points or key statements in place of `[BULLET POINTS LIST]`.

- **Polite Reminder**
  - **Purpose:** Write a follow-up or reminder email.
  - **Prompt:** "Write a polite reminder email to [RECIPIENT] about [SUBJECT] if they have not responded."
  - **Customize:** Replace `[RECIPIENT]` and `[SUBJECT]` with real terms; ensure any placeholder is clear.

- **Apology Email**
  - **Purpose:** Formulate an apology or acknowledgement.
  - **Prompt:** "Compose an apology email for missing a deadline on [PROJECT] to [RECIPIENT]."

  - **Prompt:** "Introduce yourself as [YOUR ROLE] and your team in an email to [RECIPIENT]. Mention [KEY DETAILS]."
  - **Customize:** Provide role, recipient, and key details or purpose.

  - **Prompt:** "Generate a professional email signature for [NAME], [POSITION], including contact info."
  - **Customize:** Provide your name, title, and optionally company name.

## Example output
- **Draft from Points:** If given points like "*Project launch delayed*, *Need meeting rescheduled*, *Awaiting approval*", the AI might produce a friendly email:
  "\"Hi [Recipient],<br> I'm writing to inform you that the project launch has been delayed due to [reason]. We will need to reschedule our meeting and await the final approval. Please let me know your availability.<br>Best regards,<br>[Your Name]\"" (formatted as an email).
- **Change Tone:** Transforming “I need the report now” with a friendly tone might yield:
  "\"Hi [Name],<br>I hope you’re well! Could you please send me the report at your earliest convenience? Thank you!<br>Best,<br>[Your Name]\"."

## Common mistakes & fixes
- **Too informal/formal tone:** If the tone is off (e.g., too casual for a boss), clarify in the prompt (“make it more formal”).
- **Missing key details:** Check that all important info (dates, numbers) is included or preserved. AI might paraphrase, so verify accuracy.
- **Run-on sentences:** If the output is hard to read, prompt the AI for bullet points or shorter sentences.
- **Generic greetings:** Ensure the AI uses an appropriate greeting/closing. If not, specify e.g. “Use a professional greeting.”

## Quality checklist
- Clearly state the email’s purpose and audience in the prompt.
- Specify tone (friendly, formal, urgent, etc.).
- Provide all facts and details the email should include.
- Review for professionalism, correct names, and accurate information.
- Do not include personal sensitive information in the prompt.
- If needed, regenerate or tweak the prompt until the email is polished.
