# Prioritize Tasks

## What this pack helps you do
Use these prompts when you need to **organize and rank tasks**. Whether you have a long to-do list or multiple projects, the AI can help sort tasks by urgency, impact, or time-sensitivity. The prompts below will ask the AI to create prioritized lists, schedules, or frameworks (e.g., Eisenhower matrix) to help you focus on what matters most and plan your next steps effectively.

## How to use these prompts safely
Give the AI full context on each task: deadlines, effort, and importance. Incorrect or missing context may lead to wrong priorities. Always review the AI’s prioritization – it’s a suggestion, not a binding plan. Be explicit if certain tasks cannot be moved or if some constraints exist (like work hours). Do not disclose any private work details or personal deadlines in the prompt. After getting the prioritized list, use your judgment to adjust for factors the AI might not know (like stakeholder preferences).

## Inputs required
Provide a list of tasks (brief descriptions) and any relevant details, such as due dates or estimated time. You may also give context like project goals or resource limits. The more complete and specific your input, the better the AI can order them. For example, list tasks as bullet points, possibly with attributes (e.g., “Task: Finish report – due tomorrow, high priority”).

## Prompts

- **Rank by Importance**
  - **Purpose:** Sort tasks by importance.
  - **Prompt:** "Here are my tasks: [TASK LIST]. Rank them by priority from highest to lowest."
  - **Customize:** Replace `[TASK LIST]` with bullet points or a numbered list of tasks.

- **Urgent vs Non-Urgent**
  - **Purpose:** Separate tasks into urgent/not urgent.
  - **Prompt:** "Categorize the following tasks into urgent and non-urgent: [TASK LIST]"
  - **Customize:** Provide your tasks list.

- **Time Estimate Scheduling**
  - **Purpose:** Create a schedule from tasks.
  - **Prompt:** "Schedule these tasks into a one-day plan, assuming each takes 1 hour and work starts at 9 AM: [TASK LIST]"
  - **Customize:** Modify times or number of tasks accordingly.

- **Eisenhower Matrix**
  - **Purpose:** Classify tasks by importance and urgency.
  - **Prompt:** "Organize these tasks into a 2x2 matrix (Urgent/Not Urgent vs. Important/Not Important): [TASK LIST]"
  - **Customize:** List your tasks.

- **Daily To-Do List**
  - **Purpose:** Pick top 5 tasks for today.
  - **Prompt:** "From this list of tasks [TASK LIST], list the top 5 you should do first today, explaining why."
  - **Customize:** Include tasks you need help prioritizing.

- **Delegate Recommendation**
  - **Purpose:** Identify tasks others could do.
  - **Prompt:** "From the tasks [TASK LIST], which ones could be delegated and to whom? Explain your reasoning."
  - **Customize:** Add tasks and context about team roles if known.

- **Goal Alignment**
  - **Purpose:** Prioritize tasks based on goals.
  - **Prompt:** "Given the goal '[GOAL]', reorder these tasks [TASK LIST] so the most relevant to the goal comes first."
  - **Customize:** Insert your goal and tasks list.

- **Time Blocking**
  - **Purpose:** Assign tasks to time blocks.
  - **Prompt:** "Create a time-block schedule for these tasks from 9 AM to 5 PM: [TASK LIST]"
  - **Customize:** Provide tasks and available hours.

- **Morning Routine List**
  - **Purpose:** Organize daily routine tasks.
  - **Prompt:** "Prioritize these morning routine tasks by order: [LIST OF ROUTINE TASKS]"
  - **Customize:** List the routine tasks (e.g., “Exercise, emails, breakfast, planning”).

- **Urgency Only**
  - **Purpose:** Focus only on deadlines.
  - **Prompt:** "Order these tasks by how soon they are due: [TASK (due date), ...]"
  - **Customize:** Include tasks with deadlines.

## Example output
- **Tasks:** “Finish report (tomorrow), Buy groceries (today), Call supplier (next week)”
  AI might respond:
  "*1. Buy groceries (due today) – urgent/important. 2. Finish report (due tomorrow) – important. 3. Call supplier (due next week) – lower priority for now.*"
- **Tasks:** Long task list with deadlines
  The AI could schedule them by time: "*9–10 AM: Emails; 10–12 PM: Write proposal; 1–3 PM: Analyze data; 3–4 PM: Team meeting; 4–5 PM: Plan next steps.*"

## Common mistakes & fixes
- **All tasks appear same priority:** Provide specific deadlines or consequences to distinguish them.
- **Ignoring deadlines:** Ensure you list due dates if they exist.
- **Schedule overload:** If too many tasks for a time frame, ask the AI to pick the most critical ones for that day instead of squeezing all in.
- **No context of goal:** Without knowing overall goals, the AI may not prioritize strategically. Include your objectives if needed.

## Quality checklist
- List tasks clearly, each on its own line or bullet.
- Include deadlines or time estimates where possible.
- Clarify your main goal or timeframe in the prompt.
- Check the final priorities for any missing context or tasks.
- Don’t give the AI private deadlines or personal info to respect privacy.
