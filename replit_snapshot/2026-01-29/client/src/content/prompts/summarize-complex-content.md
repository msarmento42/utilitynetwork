# Summarize Complex Content

## What this pack helps you do
This pack contains prompts for **condensing long documents, articles, or reports into clear summaries**. Use these prompts when you have lengthy or detailed text and need quick takeaways. The prompts guide the AI to extract main points, simplify language, and present information in digestible form (bullet points, paragraphs, or quick facts). For instance, if you input a research report or meeting transcript, these prompts can produce an executive summary or list of key ideas.

## How to use these prompts safely
When summarizing, be mindful that the AI might omit details or introduce errors. Always cross-check critical points in the summary against the original source. Specify the format and length you want (e.g., bullets, 100 words) to avoid overly brief or overly verbose summaries. If privacy is a concern, remove identifying details from the text before summarizing. Never summarize highly confidential or personal content with a public AI tool.

## Inputs required
Provide the full text or main excerpt you want to summarize. This could be an article, a document, notes, or any verbose content. If the text is very long, you might need to feed it in parts or shorten it, as AI models have input limits. You can also give the AI any specific focus (like “financial aspects” or “action items”) alongside the text.

  "* The article outlines key climate policy initiatives for 2030. * It highlights goals for emission reduction and renewable energy use. * Major challenges include funding and international coordination. * It suggests policy changes like carbon pricing and green subsidies. * The conclusion stresses urgent action to meet targets.*"
- Summarizing a meeting transcript in a paragraph might produce:
  "\"The meeting reviewed Project X status: the team has completed the research phase and identified two major risks (budget and timeline). Next steps include securing additional funding and finalizing the design by next month. Overall, attendees agreed on revised deliverables and set follow-up meetings to monitor progress.\""

## Common mistakes & fixes
- **Too broad summary:** If the AI misses details, you may need to specify length or focus. Fix by adding constraints (e.g., word limit or bullets).
- **Missing important points:** The AI might omit key ideas if the prompt isn’t clear. Ensure your prompt instructs it to capture *all* main points (e.g. “the main ideas are…”).
- **Introducing errors:** AI may hallucinate facts. Always double-check dates, names, or numbers in the summary against the source document.
- **Overly complex language:** For a simpler summary, explicitly ask for layman terms or simpler phrasing in the prompt.

## Quality checklist
- Specify the summary format (bullet list, paragraph, etc.).
- Limit length or number of points to match your needs.
- Provide the full text clearly in the prompt.
- Check the output against the original to ensure accuracy.
- Remove or anonymize any sensitive information in the input text.
- If the summary is off-topic, refine the prompt with more context or fewer assumptions.
