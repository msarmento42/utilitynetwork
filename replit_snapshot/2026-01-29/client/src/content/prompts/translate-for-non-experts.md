# Translate for Non-Experts

## What this pack helps you do
This pack helps **reinterpret specialized or technical content** into clear, non-technical language. Use it when you need to explain jargon-heavy information to a general audience. The prompts will have the AI simplify terms, use analogies, and remove unnecessary complexity. For example, translating medical, legal, or technical reports into language that anyone can understand.

## How to use these prompts safely
Provide the original content clearly, and specify how simple the translation should be (e.g., “for a layperson” or “without jargon”). Check that the simplified version retains the correct meaning. If the topic is highly specialized, consider adding an explainer about key terms. Do not share private or confidential documents with the AI; if needed, use excerpts or change names. Always verify that the simplified content is accurate and complete.

## Inputs required
Give the original technical or complex text you want to simplify. This can be a term, paragraph, or set of instructions. The more context about the intended audience (e.g., “for high school students”), the better the AI can tailor the language.

## Prompts

- **Plain Explanation**
  - **Purpose:** Simple rephrasing.
  - **Prompt:** "Translate this text into everyday language:\n\"[TECHNICAL TEXT]\""
  - **Customize:** Insert the original text in place of `[TECHNICAL TEXT]`.

- **Remove Jargon**
  - **Purpose:** Eliminate specialized terms.
  - **Prompt:** "Rewrite the following without technical jargon:\n\"[JARGON-LADEN SENTENCE]\""
  - **Customize:** Put the sentence or paragraph to simplify.

- **Short Summary**
  - **Purpose:** Condense complex info.
  - **Prompt:** "Summarize this for a non-expert: \"[LONG TEXT]\""
  - **Customize:** Provide the text to summarize.

- **Explain to a Beginner**
  - **Purpose:** Step-by-step explanation.
  - **Prompt:** "Explain the concept of [TOPIC] step-by-step in simple terms."
  - **Customize:** Name the concept.

- **Using Analogies**
  - **Purpose:** Use an analogy for clarity.
  - **Prompt:** "Explain [TOPIC] by comparing it to something familiar."
  - **Customize:** Replace `[TOPIC]` with the subject.

- **Different Audience**
  - **Purpose:** Adapt to a specific audience.
  - **Prompt:** "Explain [CONCEPT] to [AUDIENCE] (e.g. high school students, a friend)."
  - **Customize:** Specify both.

- **Layman’s Terms**
  - **Purpose:** Very plain language.
  - **Prompt:** "What is [TERM]? Explain without any specialized words."

  - **Customize:** Provide the original paragraph.

- **Audience Query**
  - **Purpose:** Use a Q&A format.
  - **Prompt:** "If a friend asked 'What does [TECH TERM] mean?', how would you answer?"
  - **Customize:** Replace `[TECH TERM]` with your term.

- **Multiple Languages**
  - **Purpose:** If also translating to another common language for clarity.
  - **Prompt:** "First, translate this text into plain English, then into [ANOTHER LANGUAGE] if needed:\n\"[TEXT]\""
  - **Customize:** Include the text and target language.

## Example output
- **Text:** “Photosynthesis is a light-dependent redox reaction.”
  Possible translation: "*Photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into food and oxygen.*"
- **Instruction:** “Attach the file to the email.”
  Simplified: "*Put the file in the email message so the other person can get it.*"

## Common mistakes & fixes
- **Still too complex:** If the output uses unfamiliar terms, ask the AI to use even simpler words or add a definition.
- **Omitting key info:** Ensure that important details aren’t lost; if they are, re-prompt to include them.

## Quality checklist
- Replace all jargon with simple synonyms or definitions.
- Use examples or analogies to clarify.
- Ensure the explanation remains accurate and complete.
- Read it as if you’re an outsider: does it make sense without prior knowledge?
- Verify any factual content or data.
