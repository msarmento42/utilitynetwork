# Clarify Requirements

## What this pack helps you do
This pack provides prompts to **refine and clarify ambiguous or complex tasks**. If you have a rough project idea or vague instructions, these prompts will help the AI ask the right questions, break the goal into concrete steps, and make implicit assumptions explicit. For example, if you have a one-line request ("Plan a marketing strategy"), prompts here can generate clarifying questions or detailed sub-tasks to ensure the AI (and you) fully understand the objective. The output will be a clearer task description or a list of actions, reducing misunderstandings before proceeding.

## How to use these prompts safely
Treat each prompt as a guide for the AI to understand context better. Always review the AI’s clarifications: ensure the questions or details it generates make sense and truly address your needs. **Verify any assumptions** the AI makes and correct them if needed. Remember not to share sensitive details in your prompts; use placeholder or generic descriptions (e.g., “Company X” instead of the real name). These prompts help structure the conversation, but you must still use your judgment to confirm that the AI’s interpretation matches your intent.

## Inputs required
Provide the initial task or requirement description you want to clarify. This might be a sentence or paragraph describing your goal, project, or problem. Be sure to include any known context (e.g. target audience, deadline, tools available) so the AI can ask relevant questions. For example, your input might be a sketchy job ad or a broad project statement; the prompts below will use it to generate clarifying questions or more detailed instructions.

## Prompts

- **Clarify Task**
  - **Purpose:** Refine an unclear task description into specific details.
  - **Prompt:** "The user has a task: `[YOUR TASK HERE]`. List 3 clarifying questions that would help understand the requirements fully."
  - **Customize:** Replace `[YOUR TASK HERE]` with the actual task description or goal.

- **Break Down Steps**
  - **Purpose:** Split a general goal into actionable steps.
  - **Prompt:** "Given the goal `[YOUR TASK HERE]`, outline 5 concrete steps or sub-tasks needed to accomplish it."
  - **Customize:** Replace `[YOUR TASK HERE]` with your goal or project name.

- **Assumptions List**
  - **Purpose:** Identify assumptions or missing info in a task description.
  - **Prompt:** "For the task '[YOUR TASK HERE]', list any assumptions or missing details that are needed to proceed successfully."
  - **Customize:** Input your task description in place of `[YOUR TASK HERE]`.

- **Summarize and Question**
  - **Purpose:** Summarize the given task and ask for details.
  - **Prompt:** "The project is described as: '[YOUR TASK HERE]'. First, summarize this task in your own words. Then ask two questions to clarify the scope or requirements."
  - **Customize:** Input your task text at `[YOUR TASK HERE]`.

- **Convert to Questions**
  - **Purpose:** Transform a requirement statement into specific questions.
  - **Prompt:** "Convert the following vague request into clear questions: '[YOUR TASK HERE]'."
  - **Customize:** Replace with the original request or statement.

- **Define Success Criteria**
  - **Purpose:** Specify what 'done' looks like for a task.
  - **Prompt:** "For the objective '[YOUR TASK HERE]', describe 3 measurable criteria that would indicate success."
  - **Customize:** Use your objective or deliverable in place of `[YOUR TASK HERE]`.

- **Ask the Expert**
  - **Purpose:** Role-play to elicit expert insight on a task.
  - **Prompt:** "You are a project manager. A team member says: '[YOUR TASK HERE]'. What clarifying questions would you ask them?"
  - **Customize:** Replace with the team member’s vague task description.

- **Compare Approaches**
  - **Purpose:** Explore different ways to approach a task.
  - **Prompt:** "What are two possible approaches to achieve '[YOUR TASK HERE]' and what additional information would you need for each?"
  - **Customize:** Insert your goal at `[YOUR TASK HERE]`.

- **Turn Statements into Questions**
  - **Purpose:** Ensure all details are covered by questioning.
  - **Prompt:** "Rewrite the statement '[YOUR TASK HERE]' as three separate questions about what needs to be done."
  - **Customize:** Input the original statement.

- **Role Clarifier**
  - **Purpose:** Use a persona to ask clarifying questions.
  - **Prompt:** "As a [ROLE] (e.g., 'software developer' or 'marketing specialist'), list 3 questions you would ask to clarify the task: '[YOUR TASK HERE]'."
  - **Customize:** Choose a relevant role and include it and your task.

## Example output
- For input task "*Plan a social media campaign for a new product launch*": AI might ask, "**Who is the target audience?**", "**What is the budget and timeline?**", and "**Which social platforms are you considering?**".
- For goal "*Improve website performance*": AI could outline steps like "*1. Identify current performance metrics,* 2. **List technical factors (e.g. images, scripts)**, 3. **Propose improvements (caching, compression)**, etc.*, helping to clarify the project.

## Common mistakes & fixes
- **Too vague prompt:** If the AI’s clarifying questions are off-target, your prompt may have been too broad. Fix by giving more context in the input (e.g. industry, goals).
- **No useful questions:** AI may only rephrase the statement. Remedy: Instruct it explicitly to ask questions (“List questions…”).
- **Missing details:** If important factors (budget, audience) weren’t mentioned, the AI can’t clarify them. Always include whatever context you have, or ask the AI what’s missing.
- **Ignoring constraints:** If your task has limits (time, cost) and you didn’t mention them, remind the AI by adding that info in the prompt.

## Quality checklist
- Include a clear role or perspective if helpful (e.g. project manager).
- Provide all known context (audience, deadline, tools).
- Use specific, constrained language (e.g. “List 3 questions”).
- Check the AI’s clarifying questions or steps for relevance and accuracy.
- Avoid oversharing: do not put confidential details in the prompt.
- If output is incorrect, refine the prompt and try again (for example, break it into smaller pieces).
