# Draft Proposals

## What this pack helps you do
This pack offers prompts for **creating structured proposals**. Use these when you need to draft a business proposal, project pitch, or any formal plan. The prompts guide the AI to generate sections such as objectives, benefits, scope, and next steps. Whether you start with bullet points or a brief idea, the AI can expand it into a coherent proposal outline or text.

## How to use these prompts safely
Clearly state the proposal’s purpose and audience. AI may assume facts, so ensure critical project details (budget, timeline, deliverables) are accurate. Verify any figures or claims in the draft. Keep proprietary information out of prompts, using placeholders if needed. After generating, review the proposal for business relevance and compliance with any legal or company guidelines. Use the AI output as a draft foundation – you must tailor it to your situation.

## Inputs required
Provide the core idea of your proposal: the project description, goals, or key points. For example, list project objectives, benefits, or your main request (e.g. funding amount). You might give bullet points of requirements or a short summary. The more detail you supply (like intended audience, constraints), the better the AI can flesh out the proposal.

## Example output
- **Topic:** “New CRM Implementation”
  The AI might produce:
  "*Executive Summary:* This proposal outlines a plan to implement a new Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The goal is to streamline sales and improve customer data analysis. Expected benefits include increased sales efficiency and better customer support. We request approval for an initial budget of \$50,000. *Objectives:* 1) Select CRM software; 2) Train sales team; 3) Integrate existing data. *Conclusion:* Approving this project will enhance productivity and ROI.*"

## Common mistakes & fixes
- **Lacking specifics:** If the AI’s draft is too general, provide more details like target metrics or dates.
- **Mixed sections:** AI might merge sections incorrectly. Specify structure (e.g., ask for bullet points vs paragraphs).
- **Overly long text:** For clarity, ask for bullet outlines or shorter summaries.
- **Misaligned focus:** Ensure the AI knows the proposal’s audience (e.g., executives vs technical team) to adjust tone.

## Quality checklist
- Clearly state the proposal’s goal and audience.
- Include key details (budget, timeline, metrics).
- Check that all sections (intro, objectives, etc.) are present.
- Verify numbers and claims against your data.
- Keep confidential business details out of the prompt.
