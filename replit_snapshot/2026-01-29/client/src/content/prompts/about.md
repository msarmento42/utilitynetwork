The Everyday AI Prompt Library is a practical resource designed to help people leverage AI in daily tasks safely and effectively. Our goal is to provide **high-quality, evergreen prompt templates** that users can copy, adapt, and use immediately. Each prompt is accompanied by explanations, example outputs, and tips on customization. We focus on universal tasks (like writing emails or summarizing text) so these prompts stay relevant over time.

**Responsible AI use is central to our mission.** We emphasize the principles of clear, guided prompting and careful review of AI results. By defining a specific **role** for the AI, giving it the necessary **context**, and setting explicit **constraints** (such as format or style), users can guide the AI to produce more accurate and useful output. We draw on best practices in prompt engineering: clarity and specificity in your instructions lead to better results.

Equally important is **verifying output and protecting privacy**. Generative AI models can confidently generate incorrect or outdated information. We strongly advise users to **fact-check** any AI-generated content against trusted references. Never treat AI output as final advice, especially for critical areas like health, legal, or financial decisions. In line with recommended guidelines, do *not* input sensitive or personally identifiable information into any AI system. AI services may retain prompts for training, so keep all personal data out of these queries.

Our library does **not** replace expert guidance. We include disclaimers reminding users that our content is for general informational purposes. For specialized issues (legal, medical, financial, etc.), consult qualified professionals. We encourage transparency: users should know that AI is involved in content generation and should critically evaluate its suggestions. In short, **use the prompts as smart shortcuts, not magic bullets.** Always use your judgment, cross-check facts, and keep your private data private.

Thank you for trusting the Everyday AI Prompt Library. We hope it empowers you to work smarter while maintaining safety and accuracy.
