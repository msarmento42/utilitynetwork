# Spot Weak Arguments

## What this pack helps you do
Use these prompts to **critique a claim or argument** by finding logical weaknesses or unspoken assumptions. These prompts will have the AI act as a critical reviewer: it can point out flaws, suggest counterarguments, or request evidence. For example, given an opinion piece or reasoning for a decision, the AI can highlight areas that seem unfounded or need more support.

## How to use these prompts safely
Provide the argument or claim clearly, and be specific about what needs checking. The AI’s critique is based on logic, but double-check any factual counterpoints it raises. If it makes a mistake (AI can make reasoning errors), refine your prompt or ask for clarification. Keep the critique professional: these prompts help with analysis, not attacking a person. As always, do not include private or sensitive arguments in your prompt.

## Inputs required
Present the statement, claim, or argument to analyze. This could be a sentence or paragraph. Optionally include context (e.g., the field or perspective). For example, input a claim like “XYZ is the best choice because...”. The AI will then examine and point out issues.

## Prompts

- **Identify Logical Flaws**
  - **Purpose:** Find errors in reasoning.
  - **Prompt:** "Analyze the argument '[ARGUMENT]'. Identify any logical flaws or unsupported assumptions."
  - **Customize:** Insert the argument or claim at `[ARGUMENT]`.

- **Ask Challenging Questions**
  - **Purpose:** Generate questions that test the argument.
  - **Prompt:** "What questions would you ask to challenge the statement: '[STATEMENT]'?"
  - **Customize:** Replace `[STATEMENT]` with the argument or assertion.

- **Counterargument Generation**
  - **Purpose:** Provide opposing viewpoints.
  - **Prompt:** "Provide a counterargument to: '[ARGUMENT]'."
  - **Customize:** Fill in the original argument.

- **Highlight Weak Evidence**
  - **Purpose:** Identify weak evidence or gaps.
  - **Prompt:** "What evidence is needed to support '[ARGUMENT]'? Where is evidence missing?"
  - **Customize:** Insert the argument to examine.

- **Check Consistency**
  - **Purpose:** Look for contradictions.
  - **Prompt:** "Are there any contradictions or inconsistencies in this claim? \n'[CLAIM]'"
  - **Customize:** Put your claim at `[CLAIM]`.

- **Alternative View**
  - **Purpose:** Reframe argument differently.
  - **Prompt:** "Rewrite the argument '[ARGUMENT]' from an opposing perspective."
  - **Customize:** Provide the argument.

- **Simplify and Critique**
  - **Purpose:** Restate argument simply and note issues.
  - **Prompt:** "Simplify this statement and point out what evidence you'd question:\n'[ARGUMENT]'"
  - **Customize:** Use the argument.

- **Bias Detection**
  - **Purpose:** Check for bias.
  - **Prompt:** "Does the argument '[ARGUMENT]' show any bias or subjective language?"
  - **Customize:** Replace with your argument text.

- **Evaluate Implications**
  - **Purpose:** Consider the consequences.
  - **Prompt:** "If '[ARGUMENT]' is true, what implications or problems might arise?"
  - **Customize:** Insert the argument.

- **Strengthen vs. Weaken**
  - **Purpose:** Suggest ways to improve or how it could fail.
  - **Prompt:** "What additional information would strengthen this argument? What could weaken it?\n'[ARGUMENT]'"
  - **Customize:** Include the argument.

## Example output
- **Argument:** “Renewable energy is too unreliable to use.”
  The AI might say: "*This claim assumes that all renewable sources are unreliable, which isn’t true. It ignores battery storage and grid management. Also, it doesn’t consider decreasing costs of renewables. To test this, one would ask for data on uptime of renewable plants vs. costs of outages.*"
- **Claim:** “We should double the budget for Project X.”
  Possible critique: "*Why double it? The argument doesn’t show past budget overruns or ROI. It assumes more money equals success, but maybe reallocation is needed. Key evidence needed: project performance metrics and cost breakdown.*"

## Common mistakes & fixes
- **Overly broad prompts:** If the critique is shallow, specify what type of issues to look for (logic, evidence, bias).
- **AI argues blindly:** Sometimes the AI may agree with the argument. In that case, ask explicitly for flaws or alternate views.
- **Missing context:** If the argument seems to have external dependencies, provide more background to avoid misinterpretation.

## Quality checklist
- Provide the exact claim or argument clearly.
- Ask for specific analyses (flaws, assumptions, evidence gaps).
- Verify the AI’s points with logical reasoning or facts.
- Look out for AI mistakes (it can overlook subtle errors).
- Do not input personal arguments or privileged opinions.
