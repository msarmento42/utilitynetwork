Welcome to the **Everyday AI Prompt Library**, a collection of copy-paste prompt templates to help you get real work done faster. Each prompt pack below addresses a common need (like writing emails or summarizing text) and provides structured prompts you can customize. When using AI, it’s best to be **specific and clear**: always define the AI’s _role_, provide necessary _context_, and set any _constraints_ (length, format, tone, etc.) in your prompt. Clear, precise prompts typically yield more accurate responses.

Each prompt pack page includes example prompts, outputs, and advice. **Safety first:** AI can make mistakes or hallucinate facts, so **always review and verify** its responses. Likewise, **never include personal or confidential information** in a prompt. Treat AI output as a first draft or inspiration, not a final answer. Now explore our prompt packs below:

- **[Clarify Requirements](/prompts/clarify-requirements/):** Refine vague or complex tasks by generating clarifying questions and breaking them into actionable steps.
- **[Summarize Complex Content](/prompts/summarize-complex-content/):** Turn long documents or detailed text into concise summaries or bullet points for quick understanding.
- **[Compare Options](/prompts/compare-options/):** Evaluate and contrast multiple choices (products, plans, ideas) by listing pros/cons or scoring against criteria.
- **[Write Better Emails](/prompts/write-better-emails/):** Improve your email drafts or generate professional correspondence with the right tone and structure.
- **[Explain Like I’m Five](/prompts/explain-like-five/):** Break down technical or complex concepts into simple terms using analogies and everyday examples.
- **[Prioritize Tasks](/prompts/prioritize-tasks/):** Organize to-do lists or projects by urgency and importance, creating clear action plans.
- **[Draft Proposals](/prompts/draft-proposals/):** Create outlines, introductions, and detailed content for business or project proposals.
- **[Generate Alternatives](/prompts/generate-alternatives/):** Brainstorm different solutions or variations on an idea to explore new approaches.

- **[Translate for Non-Experts](/prompts/translate-for-non-experts/):** Rephrase specialized or technical text into plain language suited for general audiences.

Each page above offers step-by-step guidance. Enjoy faster, smarter work with AI – but remember: double-check all outputs against reliable sources and protect your privacy.
