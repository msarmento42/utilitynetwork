# Generate Alternatives

## What this pack helps you do
These prompts assist you in **brainstorming alternative solutions or ideas**. If you have one approach or idea and want different perspectives, use these prompts to ask the AI for variations. Whether it’s alternative project ideas, design options, or phrasing choices, these prompts will generate multiple options or angles. For example, if you have a marketing strategy idea, the AI can suggest different campaigns or creative twists.

## How to use these prompts safely
Be clear about the original idea so the AI can generate relevant alternatives. The AI may generate impractical or unusual suggestions—use your judgment to filter them. If confidentiality is needed, don’t provide sensitive strategy details; instead, describe the scenario generally. Remember to verify that any factual statements in the alternatives (like regulations or data) are correct. Treat these prompts as creative aids, not guaranteed solutions.

## Inputs required
Provide the base idea, plan, or statement you want alternatives for. This could be a sentence describing the idea or a short paragraph. Optionally, specify the number of alternatives or any constraints (budget, style) in the prompt. For instance, you might say “Generate 5 different marketing slogans for [PRODUCT].” Include enough context so the AI’s suggestions are on target.

- **Phrase:** “Increase user engagement.”
  The AI could output variations: "*Boost user interaction, Enhance user activity, Raise user participation, Improve user involvement.*"

## Common mistakes & fixes
- **Unrelated alternatives:** If suggestions veer off-topic, refine the original idea in the prompt or add a reminder of the goal.
- **Reusing the same idea:** Ensure the prompt explicitly asks for different alternatives (use words like “different” or “another way”).
- **Missing context:** If the AI doesn’t produce useful options, add more background or constraints to the prompt.

## Quality checklist
- Clearly define the original idea or problem.
- Ask explicitly for multiple distinct options (e.g., “List X alternatives”).
- Check that the alternatives meet any constraints you have.
- Verify any factual claims made in the suggestions.
- Don’t input sensitive plans; use generic descriptions if needed.
