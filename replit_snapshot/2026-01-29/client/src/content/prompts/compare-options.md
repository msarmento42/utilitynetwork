# Compare Options

## What this pack helps you do
This pack offers prompts for **evaluating and comparing different options**. Whether you have two products, job offers, plans, or any alternatives, these prompts guide the AI to list advantages and disadvantages, weigh criteria, or make a recommendation. Use them to get a structured comparison that highlights the differences and key factors for each choice. For example, to compare software A vs B, prompts can generate side-by-side lists of features, costs, and ideal use cases.

## How to use these prompts safely
Ensure that all relevant details about each option are given to the AI. Omitting critical info (like costs or requirements) may lead to incomplete comparisons. Check that the comparison focuses only on realistic criteria you care about. Since AI might favor or assume biases, verify that the presented pros/cons align with known facts. *Never include sensitive or proprietary data* when describing options. And remember to fact-check any specific claims (e.g., specifications or statistics) against reliable sources.

## Inputs required
List the options you want compared and any relevant details (such as features, prices, or context). For best results, provide specific criteria or goals. For example, if comparing two job offers, include salary, responsibilities, and company info. If comparing plans, list features or intended outcomes. Clearly label each option in your input so the AI knows what’s being compared.

## Prompts

- **Side-by-Side Pros and Cons**
  - **Purpose:** List advantages and disadvantages of each option.
  - **Prompt:** "Compare Option A and Option B:\nA: `[DESCRIPTION OF OPTION A]`\nB: `[DESCRIPTION OF OPTION B]`\nList the pros and cons of each."
  - **Customize:** Replace bracketed parts with descriptions or names of your options.

- **Recommendation by Criteria**
  - **Purpose:** Recommend the best option based on criteria.
  - **Prompt:** "Given these criteria: [CRITERIA LIST], and options A (`[OPTION A]`) and B (`[OPTION B]`), which option is better and why?"
  - **Customize:** Fill in criteria (e.g., cost, performance), and describe A and B.

- **Feature Comparison Table**
  - **Purpose:** Outline key features side by side.
  - **Prompt:** "Create a table comparing the features of `[OPTION A]` and `[OPTION B]`, including any differences in performance, price, and usage."
  - **Customize:** Replace with names of the two items or solutions.

- **Score Ranking**
  - **Purpose:** Assign scores and rank options.
  - **Prompt:** "Rate Option A and Option B on a scale of 1–10 for each of these factors: [FACTOR 1], [FACTOR 2], [FACTOR 3]. Then sum the scores and state which is better overall."
  - **Customize:** List relevant factors and describe your options.

- **Brief Explanation**
  - **Purpose:** Give a quick comparative summary.
  - **Prompt:** "In two sentences, summarize the main difference between `[OPTION A]` and `[OPTION B]`."
  - **Customize:** Use your option names or key traits.

- **Decision Flow**
  - **Purpose:** Break down a decision tree.
  - **Prompt:** "If you were choosing between `[OPTION A]` and `[OPTION B]` for [SCENARIO], what questions would you ask or factors would you consider first?"
  - **Customize:** Provide a scenario or goal context and option names.

- **Use-Case Advice**
  - **Purpose:** Match each option to best use-cases.
  - **Prompt:** "For the following situations, which is more suitable: `[OPTION A]` or `[OPTION B]`? Explain for each."
  - **Customize:** List scenarios (e.g. "Working from home", "Budget constraint").

- **Combination Strategy**
  - **Purpose:** Consider using both options.
  - **Prompt:** "Is there a way to combine `[OPTION A]` and `[OPTION B]` to get the best result? Explain how or why not."
  - **Customize:** Input your options.

- **Risk and Benefit**
  - **Purpose:** Evaluate trade-offs.
  - **Prompt:** "What are the risks of choosing `[OPTION A]` over `[OPTION B]`, and vice versa?"
  - **Customize:** Name your options.

- **Pros vs Cons**
  - **Purpose:** Direct pros/cons listing.
  - **Prompt:** "For `[OPTION A]` and `[OPTION B]`, list the top 2 pros and top 2 cons of each."
  - **Customize:** State each option clearly.

## Example output
- **Options:** Two smartphones (A: Model X, B: Model Y)
  The AI might output:
  "*Model X – Pros: longer battery life, lower price; Cons: fewer camera features, no wireless charging.* *Model Y – Pros: high-resolution camera, fast processor; Cons: higher cost, heavier design.*"
- **Options:** Job Offer A vs B
  The AI might say: "*Job A has a higher salary and flexible hours (Pro) but less growth potential (Con). Job B offers rapid career advancement and stock options (Pro) but requires longer hours (Con).*"

## Common mistakes & fixes
- **Imbalanced detail:** If one option’s list is much longer, ensure you provided equal information about both. Add missing details for fairness.
- **Overlooked criteria:** AI may miss a relevant factor. Fix by specifying the exact factors or asking follow-up questions.
- **Biased recommendation:** The AI may favor an option without justification. In that case, ask explicitly for evidence or a balanced view.
- **Ignoring context:** Make sure the prompt includes the context of who is choosing (e.g., user needs or priorities). Without it, the comparison may not fit your scenario.

## Quality checklist
- Clearly label each option in the prompt (e.g. “Option A: ..., Option B: ...”).
- Specify any criteria or context relevant to the comparison.
- Instruct the AI on output format (bullet list, table, etc.) if needed.
- Verify any numerical or factual claims about the options.
- Avoid giving the AI sensitive proprietary information about the options.
- If the comparison seems off, clarify your prompt with more details or constraints.
