# Explain Like I’m Five

## What this pack helps you do
Use these prompts to have the AI **break down difficult concepts into simple, easy-to-understand explanations**. Often called “ELI5” (Explain Like I’m 5), this style uses analogies and plain language as if speaking to a child. It’s useful for learning complex topics or communicating with non-experts. For example, you could explain how blockchain works by comparing it to a public ledger that everyone can see.

## How to use these prompts safely
While simplifying, the AI may lose nuance. Always verify the simplified explanation against a trusted source to ensure it’s still correct. If the explanation seems too vague, add more context or ask follow-up questions for clarity. Do not rely on AI for detailed technical accuracy—use it as a learning aid. Remember, even with simple explanations, avoid sharing sensitive data or personal stories in the prompt.

## Inputs required
Provide the concept or material to explain in simple terms. This can be a word, a sentence, or a paragraph describing the technical concept. You may also specify the intended audience (e.g., a child or beginner). The AI will then reframe this input into layman’s terms.

## Prompts

- **Basic Concept Explanation**
  - **Purpose:** Explain a technical term or idea simply.
  - **Prompt:** "Explain [CONCEPT] as if I am a 5-year-old."
  - **Customize:** Replace `[CONCEPT]` with the topic to explain (e.g. “photosynthesis”).

- **Analogy-Based Explanation**
  - **Purpose:** Use a metaphor or analogy in the explanation.
  - **Prompt:** "Explain [CONCEPT] using a simple analogy."
  - **Customize:** Insert the concept to clarify with an everyday example (e.g. “the internet”).

- **Short and Sweet**
  - **Purpose:** Give a very brief explanation.
  - **Prompt:** "In one or two sentences, explain [CONCEPT] in simple terms."
  - **Customize:** State the concept clearly.

- **Using Simple Words**
  - **Purpose:** Translate jargon into everyday language.
  - **Prompt:** "Rewrite this explanation in everyday language: '[TECHNICAL TEXT]'."
  - **Customize:** Paste the original text inside the quotes.

- **Example Demonstration**
  - **Purpose:** Provide a step-by-step simple explanation.
  - **Prompt:** "Explain [CONCEPT] step by step for a young child."
  - **Customize:** Fill in the specific concept.

- **Compare to Familiar Object**
  - **Purpose:** Relate a concept to a familiar object or experience.
  - **Prompt:** "Explain [CONCEPT] by comparing it to [COMMON ITEM]."
  - **Customize:** Replace `[COMMON ITEM]` with something relatable (like “a library” for knowledge).

- **Ask the Child**
  - **Purpose:** Identify confusion by asking questions.
  - **Prompt:** "If a 5-year-old asked about [CONCEPT], what question might they ask, and how would you answer?"
  - **Customize:** Provide the concept in question.

- **Translation to Kid**
  - **Purpose:** Turn adult explanation into child-friendly words.
  - **Prompt:** "Here is a description: '[TEXT]'. Explain it so a child could understand."
  - **Customize:** Put the original description in place of `[TEXT]`.

- **Cartoon Style**
  - **Purpose:** Explain in a fun, story-like way.
  - **Prompt:** "Tell a short story for kids that explains [CONCEPT]."
  - **Customize:** Mention the concept clearly.

- **Kid-Friendly Definitions**
  - **Purpose:** Define a term simply.
  - **Prompt:** "What does [TERM] mean? Explain it in a simple way."
  - **Customize:** Input the term to define.

## Example output
- For the concept "*Internet*", the AI might output: "*The internet is like a huge library full of books. Each computer is like a reader in that library. When you search for something, it’s as if the reader is looking up a book and giving you the answer.*"
- For explaining "*gravity*", it might say: "*Gravity is like an invisible hand that pulls things toward the ground, so when you drop a ball, gravity brings it down.*"

## Common mistakes & fixes
- **Over-simplification:** The AI might omit important details. If the explanation is wrong, add more context or ask for examples.
- **Too technical language:** If the output still sounds complex, prompt it again using phrases like “use only words a child knows.”
- **Lengthy answer:** If explanation is too long, specify a shorter response. Child explanations are usually very concise.

## Quality checklist
- Use very simple words and short sentences.
- Include analogies or examples children know (toys, animals, daily life).
- Verify that key facts aren’t changed when simplifying.
- Check that the explanation is accurate enough for a general understanding.
- Keep the tone friendly and engaging.
