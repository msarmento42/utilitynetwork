# Refactoring Legacy Code with AI

Legacy code is the silent killer of productivity. It's the code everyone is afraid to touch. But with modern AI coding assistants, we have a new weapon.

## The "Explain and Refactor" Loop

1. **Paste** a confusing function into your AI tool.
2. **Ask** for an explanation in plain English.
3. **Request** a refactor for readability, keeping the logic identical.
4. **Write Tests** generated by the AI to verify behavior.

## Example

```javascript
// Before
function c(x) {
  return x * 9 / 5 + 32;
}

// After (AI Suggested)
function celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius) {
  return (celsius * 9) / 5 + 32;
}
```

It's simple, but doing this across thousands of lines makes a codebase maintainable again.
