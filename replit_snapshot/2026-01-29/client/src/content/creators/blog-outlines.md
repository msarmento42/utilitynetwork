## What you’ll accomplish
You'll create a clear, organized **blog post outline** ready for writing. By the end of this workflow, you'll have a list of main sections and subpoints that cover your topic in a logical order. This outline serves as a blueprint for your blog post, ensuring you cover all important information without rambling or missing critical details.

## Who this is for / when to use it
This workflow is for **writers and bloggers** who have a topic or a content brief and need to develop a structured outline. It's useful when you're starting to write a post and want to avoid writer's block by laying out the structure first. If you've ever struggled with a messy first draft or forgotten to include key points, outlining with AI can help. Use this when planning **any substantial article or guide** to save time and stay organized.

## Inputs you need
Before you outline, make sure you have:
- **The topic or headline:** What is the blog post about? (e.g., "10 Tips for Better Outdoor Photography").
- **Key points or goals:** A rough idea of what you want the post to cover or achieve. If you have a content brief (possibly created using the previous workflow), have it on hand.
- **Audience and tone:** (Optional) Who is the post for, and what style should it be? (e.g., "Beginners who appreciate a casual tone" or "Tech professionals requiring a formal approach").
- **Length or depth (optional):** Are you aiming for a quick read or an in-depth article? This can influence how detailed the outline should be.

These inputs will guide both you and the AI to produce a relevant outline.

## Step-by-step workflow
1. **Summarize the post intent:** Jot down a one-liner on what the post is about and its purpose (e.g., "Introduce beginners to basic photography tips to improve outdoor shots"). This helps keep the outline focused.
2. **Generate a high-level outline with AI:** Ask the AI for the main sections of the post. For example: *"Outline an article about **[Your Topic]** for **[Target Audience]**. Include 5-7 main sections."* The AI will likely produce something like an ordered list of major headings.
3. **Review and adjust the main sections:** Examine the AI's suggested sections. Do they make sense in your context? Reorder or rephrase headings as needed. You might combine some sections or drop others that aren't relevant. Ensure the flow is logical (e.g., introductory topics come first, more advanced or detailed points later, and a conclusion at the end).
4. **Drill down into subpoints:** For each main section, have the AI suggest details or subtopics. You can prompt: *"For the section '**[Section Title]**', what subpoints or examples should be included?"* This might give you a few bullet points to include under that section. Not every section needs subpoints, but if it's a broad section, sub-bullets help clarify what you'll cover.
5. **Incorporate transitions or links (if needed):** Think about how one section will flow to the next. While outlining, note if a transitional sentence or concept is needed (e.g., "Now that we've covered X, let's move on to Y"). AI can help here too if you ask something like, *"How can I transition from [Section A] to [Section B]?"* (This is a nice-to-have step for thoroughness; you can also handle it during writing.)
6. **Finalize the outline:** Make sure the outline has an introduction and conclusion if appropriate. The introduction in an outline might just be "Introduction - what the reader will learn," and the conclusion might be "Conclusion - summary and call to action." Ensure your outline aligns with any length or depth requirements (for instance, if you need a 500-word blog, a 10-section outline might be overkill). Trim or expand the outline accordingly.
7. **Add notes (optional):** In the outline document, you might add brief notes under each heading about what to emphasize or avoid. For example, under a section heading "Tip 1: Steady Your Shot," you could note "Include example of holding breath to avoid camera shake." These notes can come from your own ideas or additional AI prompts asking for examples or tips for that section.

## Prompt templates
Here are some prompt examples you can use while outlining:
- **Generate main outline:** *"Outline the key sections for an article about **[Topic]** aimed at **[Target Audience]**."*
  *Purpose:* Provides a list of major sections for your blog post.
- **Refine a section:** *"What details should be covered under the section **[Section Title]** in an article about **[Topic]**?"*
  *Purpose:* Helps flesh out specific sections with subpoints or examples.
- **Check outline logic:** *"Does this outline for an article about **[Topic]** cover all major points in a logical order? Here are the sections: [list of sections]."*
  *Purpose:* The AI can critique the outline order or suggest if something is missing.
- **Intro/conclusion ideas:** *"What should a reader learn from this article about **[Topic]**? How should it conclude?"*
  *Purpose:* Clarifies what to put in your introduction and conclusion sections.
- **Title or header tweak:** *"Suggest a more engaging heading for a section about **[Section Topic]**."*
  *Purpose:* Gives you alternatives if any outline heading sounds dull or unclear.

## Example output
Here's an example of what part of an AI-generated outline might look like for a post on "Tips for Outdoor Photography":

1. Introduction: Why Outdoor Photography Skills Matter
2. Tip 1 – Steady Your Shot: - Importance of stability (using tripods or stabilizing techniques)
- Example: how slight movements can blur a photo
3. Tip 2 – Lighting is Key: - Using golden hour to your advantage
- Avoiding harsh midday sun, using shade
4. Tip 3 – Composition Techniques: - Rule of thirds in landscapes
- Framing subjects with natural surroundings
5. Conclusion: Bringing It All Together

Each main point would be further detailed based on the subpoints generated.

## Common mistakes & how to fix them
- **Mistake:** Accepting a generic outline without tailoring. AI might produce an outline that feels cookie-cutter.
  **Fix:** Always customize the sections to better fit your unique angle or examples. Add or remove sections so the outline isn't just an AI fingerprint but truly yours.
- **Mistake:** Overloading the outline with too much detail. It's possible to ask the AI for so many subpoints that the outline becomes unwieldy.
  **Fix:** Remember an outline is a guide, not the full text. Keep subpoints to key phrases or ideas. You can always expand during writing.
- **Mistake:** Not providing context to the AI. If you omit the audience or goal, you might get an outline that's off-target (too advanced, too basic, or irrelevant points).
  **Fix:** Include specifics in your prompt (audience, angle, what to focus on). This yields a more relevant outline.
- **Mistake:** Ignoring logical flow. Sometimes AI suggestions are out of order (e.g., mention advanced concept before basics).
  **Fix:** After getting the outline, take a minute to rearrange sections into the best sequence. Use your judgment or even ask the AI if the order makes sense.
- **Mistake:** Forgetting the intro or conclusion. AI might list body sections but skip these.
  **Fix:** Ensure your outline begins with an introduction and ends with a conclusion or closing thoughts so your post has a clear start and finish.

## Originality & quality checklist
- **Does it cover the key points?** Cross-check your outline against the topic: would a reader feel well-informed on the subject with this structure? If not, identify what's missing.
- **Unique value:** Think about what makes your post different. If the outline looks very generic, adjust one or two sections to inject a unique perspective, case study, or personal story.
- **Reader's perspective:** For each section, consider if a reader would easily understand how it relates to the main topic. If a section seems out of place or unnecessary, remove or modify it.
- **Accuracy of points:** If the outline includes any factual claims or specific methods, ensure they are correct. (e.g., If a section is "10% Rule in Photography", make sure that's a real thing or else change it.)
- **Alignment with intent:** Check that the outline fulfills the goal you set. If your intent was a beginner-friendly guide, are all sections indeed beginner-friendly? Adjust any that are too complex or vice versa.

## Disclaimer
Outlining with AI should complement your writing process, not replace it. Always apply your own expertise to adjust the outline. The AI can suggest structure, but the best outlines come from a mix of AI input and your understanding of the topic. Use these tips responsibly to save time without sacrificing quality.
