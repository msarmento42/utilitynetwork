## How we use AI responsibly for content
We use AI as a helpful assistant in our content creation process – for brainstorming, drafting, and exploring different approaches. However, *every* piece of content on this site is reviewed, edited, and fact-checked by a human before publication. Our team ensures that AI suggestions are accurate and fit our authentic voice. We never publish raw AI output. Originality is a top priority: we combine AI-generated ideas with our own expertise and always cite sources for facts or data. If an AI tool provides a useful insight or wording, we refine it and make sure it aligns with our tone and quality standards.

In short, AI helps us work efficiently, but humans are in charge. We believe in transparency and will let you know if a significant portion of a piece was AI-assisted. Our commitment is to provide you with reliable, high-quality content – with AI as a tool in our toolkit, not a replacement for human creativity and judgment.
