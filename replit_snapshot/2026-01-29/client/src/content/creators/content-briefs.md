## What you’ll accomplish
By the end of this workflow, you'll have a comprehensive **content brief** for your next piece of content. This brief will include the article's purpose, target audience, key points or sections to cover, and any important notes (such as tone or references). Essentially, you'll create a roadmap that makes the writing process faster and more focused.

## Who this is for / when to use it
This workflow is ideal for **bloggers, content marketers, and writers** who want to plan out their content before writing. If you have a topic in mind but need to organize your thoughts, ensure you hit all the important points, or communicate your plan to others (like editors or clients), a content brief helps. It's also useful when **outsourcing writing** – a good brief guides the writer and maintains quality and consistency.

## Inputs you need
To get started, gather a few key inputs:
- **Topic or working title:** The subject you'll be writing about.
- **Audience information:** Who are you writing for? (e.g., beginners, advanced readers, a specific demographic or niche)
- **Primary goal:** What do you want to achieve with the content? (e.g., educate, persuade, entertain)
- **Key points or requirements:** Any specific points you know should be included, or keywords you want to target for SEO.
- **Preferred tone/voice:** (Optional) If you have a brand or personal voice guidelines, keep them in mind to include in the brief.

Having these inputs prepared will help you get more relevant and tailored output from the AI at each step.

## Step-by-step workflow
1. **Define the content goal and audience:** Start by clearly stating what the piece is about and who will read it. Jot down the topic, the purpose of the content (e.g., answer a question, solve a problem), and the target audience. *This context will be given to the AI in the next steps so it tailors the brief appropriately.*
2. **Brainstorm main points with AI:** Use an AI assistant to generate an initial list of sections or key points for the topic. For example, you might prompt: *"What are the key subtopics to cover in an article about [Your Topic] for [Target Audience]?"* Let the AI suggest some ideas.
3. **Expand with audience questions:** Next, find out what questions the target readers might have. Ask the AI something like: *"What questions do [Target Audience] often ask about [Your Topic]?"* This can reveal important points to include that you might not have considered.
4. **Organize and refine the outline:** Take the AI-generated points and questions, and organize them into a logical order. You now have the skeleton of your content brief. You might group related ideas, decide which points are primary sections versus supporting details, and ensure the scope isn't too broad or too narrow.
5. **Add key details and requirements:** For each section of the outline, write a sentence or two on what it should cover, and note any examples, data, or insights that need to be included. If SEO keywords are relevant, identify a few (you can even ask the AI: *"What are some related keywords or terms for [Your Topic]?"*). Also specify the desired tone or style if important (e.g., "friendly and casual" vs "professional and technical").
6. **Generate title ideas (optional):** A good title can be part of a brief. Prompt the AI for a few title options: *"Suggest 5 engaging titles for an article about [Your Topic]."* Jot down the best one or two in your brief.
7. **Review and finalize the brief:** Read through the content brief and ensure it meets your needs. Make sure each key point aligns with your goal and that nothing important is missing. Edit any AI-generated text in the brief to fit exactly what you want (AI might phrase things oddly or include irrelevant points—it's your job to refine those). The final brief should be clear enough that you (or anyone you hand it to) can start writing the actual content without confusion.

## Prompt templates
You can use variations of these prompt templates at different stages of creating your content brief. Remember to replace placeholders with your specific topic, audience, or needs:
- **Outline the main points:** *"List the major sections or topics that should be covered in an article about **[Your Topic]** for **[Target Audience]**."*
  *Purpose:* Generates a high-level outline structure.
- **Audience questions:** *"What are the top 5 questions **[Target Audience]** might have about **[Your Topic]**?"*
  *Purpose:* Ensures the content will address the actual queries and concerns of your readers.
- **Title ideas:** *"Suggest 3 attention-grabbing titles for a blog post about **[Your Topic]**."*
  *Purpose:* Provides inspiration for article headlines; you can mix and match phrases from the AI suggestions.
- **SEO keywords brainstorming:** *"Give me a list of keywords and phrases related to **[Your Topic]** that people might search for."*
  *Purpose:* Helps identify relevant terms to weave into your content for better SEO (remember to verify their relevance and search volume separately).
- **Check for missing points:** *"Am I missing any important points in a brief about **[Your Topic]** for **[Target Audience]**?"*
  *Purpose:* Asks the AI to double-check the outline and suggest if anything obvious is absent.

## Example output
Here's a **partial example** of what an AI-assisted content brief might look like (for a topic "How to Start a Blog"):
> **Title:** How to Start a Blog that Stands Out
> **Audience:** Aspiring bloggers with no technical background
> **Purpose:** Provide a step-by-step guide to launching a blog, from idea to first post
> **Key Points to Cover:**
> - Choosing a blogging platform (overview of options like WordPress, etc.)
> - Picking a niche and blog name (why focus matters)
> - Basic setup (domain, hosting, initial settings)
> - Creating your first content (tips for writing the first post)
> - Promoting your blog (intro to marketing the content)
> *...(and so on, including any specific details or examples in each section)*

## Common mistakes & how to fix them
- **Mistake:** Relying 100% on the AI's first outline. The AI might miss nuances or include too much.
  **Fix:** Treat the AI's outline as a starting draft. Combine overlapping sections, trim what isn't needed, and add points you know are important.
- **Mistake:** Being too vague in your prompts. If you just ask for an outline without context, the suggestions may be generic.
  **Fix:** Include context like your target audience and angle. For example, *"for a beginner audience"* yields a different outline than *"for experts."*
- **Mistake:** Ignoring the audience's needs. A brief can miss the mark if it doesn't answer real reader questions.
  **Fix:** Use the audience question prompt and also do a quick reality check: put yourself in the reader's shoes and ask if the brief would satisfy you.
- **Mistake:** Not verifying facts or suggestions. AI might include outdated or incorrect info (especially in technical or factual outlines).
  **Fix:** If the AI suggests specific facts or stats in the brief, double-check them. It's often safer to have the AI outline *topics* and then you fill in actual facts from research.
- **Mistake:** Letting the AI set the tone completely.
  **Fix:** Make sure the tone noted in the brief matches your style. If the AI's suggestions sound too formal or too casual, adjust the brief's guidance on voice so the writer gets it right.

## Originality & quality checklist
- **Uniqueness:** Ensure the brief includes your unique perspective or angle. Don't just use a generic outline—tweak it to highlight what makes your approach special.
- **Accuracy:** Double-check any factual points. If the brief says "90% of marketers use AI," confirm that with a reliable source or be prepared to adjust during writing.
- **Clarity:** The brief should be clear and detailed enough that someone else could write the article. Spell out acronyms, clarify any jargon, and ensure each point is understandable.
- **Completeness:** Verify that the brief covers all the main points you think the reader will care about. Compare it against similar content or a quick Google search to see if you missed something.
- **Tone & style alignment:** If you have a brand or personal voice, make sure the brief reflects that (e.g., it might note "use a humorous tone" or "keep it professional"). This helps maintain consistency later.
