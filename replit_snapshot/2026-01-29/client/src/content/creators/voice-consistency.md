## What you'll accomplish
You'll learn how to use AI to help ensure that all your content **sounds like it comes from the same person or brand**. That means consistent tone, language, and personality across articles, social posts, emails, etc. By the end, you'll be able to define your brand voice clearly and have AI assist in enforcing that style, so your audience always recognizes it's you speaking (and you don't sound like a random robot or a different person with each piece of content).

## Who this is for / when to use it
This is for **anyone with an established voice or brand style** – think content marketers, brand social media managers, or individual creators who have a particular persona. If you have multiple people or AI helping create content, and you're worried about things sounding inconsistent, this will help. Use this when:
- You're drafting content with AI and notice the tone isn't quite "on brand".
- You want to audit existing content for voice consistency (maybe you have old posts that feel off).
- You're onboarding a new writer (human or AI) to your content creation and need to align them with the brand voice quickly.

## Inputs you need
- **Brand voice description:** A list of key characteristics of your voice. For example, "friendly but professional, uses humor occasionally, avoids jargon, speaks in first person". If you don't have this written, take a moment to outline it.
- **Samples of on-brand content (optional):** If you have a piece of writing that perfectly captures your voice, have it handy. You can show AI a snippet as reference.
- **List of taboo elements (optional):** Anything your voice should avoid (e.g., no profanity, no slang, or conversely maybe no stuffy formal language).
- **Target format:** Are we talking about social posts, long-form articles, product descriptions? Voice can shift slightly by format (though core personality remains), so specify context to AI.

## Step-by-step workflow
1. **Articulate your voice guidelines:** Write down 3-5 bullet points that define your voice. For example: "Empathetic and conversational, like a helpful friend. Uses simple everyday language, contractions, and occasional light jokes. Doesn't shy away from emotional words. Avoids academic tone or excessive buzzwords." This clarity will help both you and the AI.
2. **Share voice guidelines with AI when generating content:** When you prompt AI for content, include instructions like "*in a [adjective] and [adjective] tone*". You can even feed the bullet points: *"Write the following in a voice that is: [list attributes]."* For instance, "Write a blog intro about gardening, in a casual, upbeat tone with a touch of humor (brand voice is friendly and non-technical)."
3. **Use AI to compare and analyze tone:** If you have a draft (from AI or a teammate) and you're not sure it fits the voice, ask: *"Analyze the tone of this text. Does it sound [desired voice]? Where does it differ?"* The AI might highlight sentences that are too formal or words that don't match the style.
4. **Have AI rewrite in your voice:** For sections that are off, prompt: *"Rewrite this paragraph to sound more {your voice traits}."* For example, "Rewrite this in a more playful, youthful voice while keeping the meaning." Review the output and keep the best parts. This can save time versus manually editing every line.
5. **Check for consistency across pieces:** If needed, you can even feed two pieces to AI: *"Do these two snippets sound like they could be from the same source? If not, what differences do you notice?"* This is useful if one article sounds different from another. AI might point out, say, one uses a lot of slang and the other doesn't.
6. **Create an AI voice profile (advanced):** Some tools allow you to "train" or provide a few pages of your writing so the AI mimics that style. If available, use that. If not, you can still do a manual version: give the AI a long example of your writing and then prompt it to continue in that style or to generate new content in that style.
7. **Final human polish:** Always do a final read yourself (or have someone familiar with the brand voice do it). You'll catch if something still sounds a bit off or generic. Over time, as you and the AI work together, it will require fewer adjustments.

## Prompt templates
- **Voice critique:** *"The brand voice should be **[describe]**. Does the following text match that voice? If not, what words or sentences stand out as off-tone?"*
  *Purpose:* Lets the AI act as an editor pointing out inconsistencies.
- **Tone rewrite:** *"Rewrite this sentence/paragraph in a **[desired voice description]** manner: [text]."*
  *Purpose:* Directly produces an adjusted version of content to better fit the style.
- **Voice from sample:** *"Analyze the tone in this sample: [insert a paragraph of on-brand text]. Now, write the next paragraph about **[new topic]** in the same style and voice."*
  *Purpose:* Guides the AI by example, extending your voice to new content.
- **List voice traits:** *"Based on this text, what are the characteristics of the writer's voice? [insert text]"*
  *Purpose:* Helps you verify or understand the existing voice being used, which you can compare to your target voice.
- **Check pronouns/perspective:** *"Ensure this text uses a consistent perspective and tone (e.g., first-person singular and casual). Modify if needed: [text]."*
  *Purpose:* Fixes any shifts like "we" vs "I" or formal vs informal address that might have snuck in.

## Example output
Let's say your brand voice is *confident and witty*. The AI first gave you a line: "One might find these results satisfactory." That sounds too stiff. Using a rewrite prompt you get: "You might say these results are pretty darn impressive." Now that's more on voice: it's direct ("you"), a bit playful ("pretty darn"), and confident.

Or, you provided two social media captions to the AI and asked if the voice is consistent. It responds:
> "Caption A is very casual and uses slang ('Awesome tips, check 'em out!'), whereas Caption B is more formal ('These tips are very useful, please have a look.'). To be consistent, you'd want Caption B to be more upbeat and casual like A."

With that feedback, you can adjust Caption B to match Caption A's style.

## Common mistakes & how to fix them
- **Mistake:** Not clearly defining your voice upfront. AI can't hit a target if you only say "make it sound good".
  **Fix:** Provide specific guidance. If you don't have a formal style guide, use analogies ("sound like a mix of Morgan Freeman and a friendly librarian") or key adjectives.
- **Mistake:** Expecting AI to just "know" your brand. It won't, unless you feed it sufficient examples.
  **Fix:** Whenever possible, give examples of the desired voice. Or at least mention brands or characters that have a similar tone for reference (e.g., "tone like how Nike speaks in ads" - if that's documented).
- **Mistake:** Overcorrecting into artificiality. If you push the AI too hard on certain quirks (like always using a certain greeting), the text can start to feel formulaic.
  **Fix:** Balance consistency with naturalness. It's okay if not every sentence has the exact same cadence; it's more about the overall impression. Use AI suggestions, but don't apply the same template rigidly.
- **Mistake:** Ignoring context changes. Maybe your brand voice is light, but there are times (like a serious announcement) where it should be dialed down.
  **Fix:** Remember that consistency doesn't mean monotone. You can maintain voice while adjusting tone for context (AI can help: "keep it empathetic but with a more serious tone here"). It's still you, just appropriate for the situation.
- **Mistake:** Letting AI output dilute your uniqueness. If you accept every AI phrasing, you might end up sounding more generic because the AI might default to a bland style.
  **Fix:** Always infuse some unique elements of your voice. Maybe it's a particular turn of phrase or a bit of humor only you'd use. Don't let those disappear; you can even teach them to the AI by example.

## Originality & quality checklist
- **Voice audit:** Skim through the content focusing just on tone. Does anything make you pause and think "I wouldn't say it like that"? Mark those and adjust.
- **Vocabulary consistency:** Check that common words you use (or avoid) are handled correctly. If you call your customers "clients" everywhere, ensure the AI didn't call them "users" somewhere, for example.
- **Personality intact:** Make sure the content still has personality. AI might sometimes neutralize things too much in the quest for consistency. It's better to retain a bit of character—even if that means a slight inconsistency—than to be perfectly consistent but dull.
- **Consistency across channels:** If this piece will sit alongside others (on a website, or multiple social posts), compare them. Is the voice flowing through? If one stands out as odd, give it extra attention.
- **Continuous learning:** As you refine your voice with AI, update your guidelines. If you discover the AI often makes things too formal, add "avoid formal language like 'one should' or 'thus'" to your instructions for next time. Over time, the process gets smoother.

## Disclaimer
Maintaining a consistent voice is a creative judgement call – AI can assist, but it's not foolproof. Always review AI-altered text to ensure it genuinely feels right for your brand. Think of AI as a helpful mimic, not the originator of your brand personality. The unique voice ultimately comes from you; AI just helps apply it evenly.
