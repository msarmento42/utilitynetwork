## What you'll accomplish
You'll transform an existing piece of content into multiple **new formats** using AI. For example, you can turn a blog post into a series of social media posts, a video script, an email newsletter blurb, and more. The goal is to expand your content's reach without starting from scratch each time. By the end, you'll have repurposed material ready to go, tailored to each format or platform you need.

## Who this is for / when to use it
This workflow is for **content creators, bloggers, marketers, or anyone** who wants to get more mileage out of a single piece of content. If you've written a comprehensive article, recorded a podcast, or made a video, you can use AI to help break that content down and reformat it for other channels. Use this when you want to **save time** and maintain consistency across platforms – for instance, when launching a campaign and needing blog posts, tweets, and newsletter sections all on the same theme.

## Inputs you need
- **Source content:** The original content you'll be repurposing. This could be a blog post (text), a transcript of a video or podcast, an infographic outline, etc. Having it in text form is easiest because you can feed chunks of it to an AI.
- **Target format(s) & platform:** Decide where you want to republish the content. Examples: Twitter thread, LinkedIn post, Instagram caption, YouTube video outline, email newsletter snippet, etc. Each format has its own style (e.g., character limit for tweets, more formal tone for LinkedIn).
- **Key points or sections:** Know the main takeaways or sections of your original content. Often, each main point can become one social post or one segment of a video, for instance.
- **Tone differences (if any):** Will the new format require a different tone or approach? (e.g., a scholarly blog post might need a more casual tone on social media).

## Step-by-step workflow
1. **Review and segment the original content:** Skim your source material and break it into logical chunks. For a blog post, this could be by headings or key points. For a 30-minute podcast, maybe identify 3-5 big ideas or quotes. This helps you handle one piece at a time when prompting the AI.
2. **Choose one format at a time:** It's usually best to repurpose into one format, then move to the next. Start with the format you need most (say, a Twitter thread).
3. **Prompt the AI for the new format:** Take the first chunk or key point and ask the AI to reformat it. For example: *"Turn the following point into a tweet: [text]."* Or *"Summarize this section in 2-3 sentences suitable for LinkedIn."* Be specific about style: for a tweet you might add "in a witty tone, under 280 characters", for a LinkedIn post you might say "professional tone, first-person".
4. **Compile and refine AI output:** Collect the AI's output for that format. If it's a series (like a thread), do this for each segment and then string them together in order. Read through the results and make adjustments. Ensure each piece reads well on its own and that the tone is right. You may need to tweak wording or add context—AI might shorten things too much or make them generic.
5. **Add platform-specific elements:** Edit in any hashtags, handles, or platform conventions. For instance, if you're making tweets, you might add a relevant hashtag or an emoji if appropriate. For an Instagram caption, maybe include a question to encourage comments. AI might not automatically include these, so consider this your customization step.
6. **Repeat for other formats:** Now move to the next format. Maybe take the same original content and ask the AI to create an email newsletter summary, or a script for a short video. Follow the same process: prompt, gather output, then refine and add the finishing touches for that medium.
7. **Cross-check for consistency:** If you're repurposing into multiple formats that might be seen by the same audience, ensure consistency in core message. They don't have to be identical (in fact, they shouldn't be word-for-word duplicates), but the key facts or advice should align. Also ensure you're not accidentally contradicting yourself across formats.
8. **Schedule or publish appropriately:** (This is more about workflow management, but worth mentioning.) Now that you have the content pieces, decide when/where to publish each. Perhaps the blog post goes up first, then over the next week you share the social posts, etc., to maximize the content's life.

## Prompt templates
Here are example prompts for various repurposing scenarios:
- **Blog to Twitter thread:** *"Summarize each of the following points from my article into a Twitter thread, each in 1-2 short sentences:\n1. [Point one]\n2. [Point two]\n... Provide each point as 'Tweet 1: ...', 'Tweet 2: ...'."*
  *Purpose:* Breaks a longer piece into tweet-sized chunks.
- **Content to LinkedIn post:** *"Turn the following text into a LinkedIn post. Keep it professional and insightful, around 150 words: [paragraph]."*
  *Purpose:* Adapts tone and length for a LinkedIn audience, which typically prefers a slightly more formal and narrative style.
- **Article to video script outline:** *"Create a brief video script outline (bullet points) based on this article section, as if explaining to viewers: [text]."*
  *Purpose:* Helps generate a spoken-style outline, including key talking points, which you can expand into a full script or talking video.
- **Find a quote-worthy snippet:** *"From this content, extract a punchy one-liner or quote that would work well in a social media post: [text]."*
  *Purpose:* Picks out a memorable phrase or sentence that you can highlight as a quote graphic or teaser.
- **Rephrase for a different audience:** *"Rewrite this advice for a **[new audience]** in a **[different tone]**: [original advice]."* (E.g., original for experts → rewrite for beginners in a simpler tone.)
  *Purpose:* Adapts the content so it resonates with a different demographic or skill level, which is another form of repurposing.

## Example output
Suppose you have a blog paragraph and you want two tweets out of it.
**Original snippet (from a blog):** "Content recycling is crucial. For example, one webinar can fuel a month of posts. It's about working smarter: maximizing one idea across formats saves time and keeps your audience engaged on multiple channels."

The AI might produce:
> **Tweet 1/2:** One piece of content can fuel many others. ♻ Did a webinar? Turn its best tips into blog posts, tweets, and more. Work smarter, not harder!
> **Tweet 2/2:** Consistency matters: repurpose your content so your message reaches people on different platforms. Save time *and* keep your audience engaged everywhere.

In this example, the core idea was split into two concise tweets, with an emoji added for a bit of flare and a call to action implied.

## Common mistakes & how to fix them
- **Mistake:** Not tailoring to the platform. A direct copy-paste rarely works (e.g., a long sentence from a blog will be too long and not catchy for a tweet).
  **Fix:** Use the AI to rephrase and shorten content, and always review character counts and style. Add platform-appropriate elements (hashtags, casual tone for social, etc.).
- **Mistake:** Overlooking context. An excerpt taken out of an article might confuse readers if standalone (like referencing something not explained).
  **Fix:** Ensure each repurposed piece includes enough context to stand on its own. This might mean adding a brief intro line or modifying pronouns/names to be clear.
- **Mistake:** Over-reliance on AI without human touch. AI might churn out bland or overly generic posts that sound formulaic.
  **Fix:** Infuse some personality or specific details. Use AI's draft as a base, then tweak words or add a personal comment/joke if it suits the platform.
- **Mistake:** Repurposing content that doesn't fit the new medium. For instance, a very technical whitepaper snippet might flop as an Instagram caption.
  **Fix:** If the content isn't naturally a good fit, consider changing the angle. Perhaps extract a simpler insight from it for Instagram, rather than trying to summarize dense info directly.
- **Mistake:** Ignoring performance and feedback. This is post-workflow, but worth noting: you might push repurposed content without seeing how it does.
  **Fix:** After posting, gauge engagement. If one format's post isn't working (no likes, shares, etc.), learn from it. Maybe the tone was off or the content wasn't right for that audience. Adjust your strategy next time.

## Originality & quality checklist
- **Value in each format:** Check that each repurposed piece provides value on its own. A social post should have a takeaway or intrigue to click through; a newsletter snippet should make sense in context of the email.
- **No blatant duplication:** If the same person follows you on multiple channels, will they just see the *exact* same wording repeated? It's okay if messages echo, but vary the wording or examples so it doesn't feel copy-pasted everywhere.
- **Tone fit:** Confirm the tone matches the platform – e.g., conversational for Twitter, perhaps more polished for LinkedIn, enthusiastic and snappy for an Instagram caption, etc.
- **Accuracy and tweaks:** Ensure any data or references from the original are still accurate and cited if needed in the new format. If you trimmed out context that included a disclaimer or nuance, double-check you aren't misrepresenting info in the shortened version.
- **Brand consistency:** Even while adapting, keep core brand elements consistent (correct product names, taglines, or key phrases you always use). AI might paraphrase something important (like your product name or slogan) – revert those to the proper form.

## Disclaimer
When repurposing content with AI, remember that quality comes first. AI can speed up the process of reformatting and rewriting, but it's your responsibility to ensure the final output is appropriate for each platform and audience. Use AI-generated drafts as a starting point, and refine them so they truly resonate with your followers on each channel.
