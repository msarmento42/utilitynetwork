# Meeting Notes → Action Items Workflow

## What You'll Accomplish
By the end of this workflow, you'll be able to take raw meeting notes and transform them into a clear, actionable task list. You'll never walk out of a meeting wondering "what am I supposed to do next?" You'll also learn how AI can help extract action items, identify owners, and summarize key decisions.

## Who This Is For
This workflow is for anyone who attends meetings and needs to track follow-ups. It's especially helpful if you:
- Often leave meetings without clear next steps.
- Take lots of notes but struggle to find the action items afterward.
- Want to share meeting summaries with your team.
- Attend back-to-back meetings and need a quick way to process notes.

## Inputs
- **Meeting notes:** Your raw notes from the meeting (handwritten, typed, or recorded and transcribed).
- **Context about attendees:** Who was in the meeting and their roles (helpful for assigning tasks).
- **(Optional) AI assistant:** A chatbot to help extract and organize action items from your notes.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Capture Notes During the Meeting
As the meeting progresses, jot down:
- Key discussion points
- Decisions made
- Any task mentioned (even informally)
- Names associated with commitments ("John will send the report")
- Deadlines mentioned

Don't worry about formatting – just capture the information.

### Step 2: Review Notes Immediately After
Within 15 minutes of the meeting ending, review your notes while the context is fresh. Fill in any gaps, clarify abbreviations, and highlight anything that looks like an action item.

### Step 3: Extract Action Items
Go through your notes and identify every task or follow-up. An action item should have:
- **What:** A clear description of the task
- **Who:** The person responsible
- **When:** A deadline or timeframe (if mentioned)

Example: "John will send the Q4 budget report by Friday"

### Step 4: Use AI to Assist (Optional)
Paste your meeting notes into an AI assistant and ask: "Extract all action items from these meeting notes. For each item, identify the task, owner, and deadline if mentioned." The AI can quickly scan through and pull out tasks you might have missed.

You can also ask: "Summarize the key decisions from this meeting in 3 bullet points."

### Step 5: Create a Task List
Transfer the action items to your task management system (to-do app, project tool, or even a simple list). Make sure each item has:
- A clear description
- An assigned owner
- A due date

### Step 6: Share the Summary
If appropriate, send a brief email or message to meeting attendees with:
- Key decisions made
- Action items with owners and deadlines
- Any open questions for follow-up

This creates accountability and ensures everyone has the same understanding.

### Step 7: Follow Up
Add follow-up reminders to your calendar. Check in before deadlines to ensure tasks are on track. At the next meeting, review whether previous action items were completed.

## Prompt Templates
- "Here are my notes from today's meeting: [paste notes]. Extract all action items, including who is responsible and any deadlines mentioned."
- "Summarize these meeting notes into 3-5 key points and list all follow-up tasks: [paste notes]"
- "I attended a project planning meeting. Here are my notes: [paste notes]. Create a task list I can add to my project management tool."
- "Based on these meeting notes, draft a brief follow-up email I can send to attendees summarizing decisions and action items: [paste notes]"

## Example Output

**Meeting:** Product Launch Planning (Jan 16, 2026)

**Key Decisions:**
- Launch date set for March 15
- Marketing will lead the announcement campaign
- Engineering to complete final testing by Feb 28

**Action Items:**
| Task | Owner | Due Date |
|------|-------|----------|
| Finalize product pricing | Sarah | Jan 20 |
| Create launch announcement draft | Mark | Jan 25 |
| Complete integration testing | Dev Team | Feb 28 |
| Book launch event venue | Lisa | Jan 30 |
| Prepare customer support FAQ | Support Lead | Feb 15 |

## Common Mistakes
- **Not taking notes at all:** Relying on memory leads to missed action items. Always capture something.
- **Vague action items:** "Discuss the project" is not actionable. Be specific: "Create project timeline by Friday."
- **No assigned owner:** Tasks without owners don't get done. Every action item needs a person responsible.
- **No deadlines:** Tasks without due dates get pushed indefinitely. Always assign a timeframe.
- **Not reviewing notes afterward:** Notes are useless if you never look at them again. Process them immediately.
- **Over-relying on AI for sensitive meetings:** Be cautious about pasting confidential meeting content into AI tools.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Every action item has an assigned owner.
- [ ] Every action item has a due date (or at least a timeframe).
