# Decision-Making Workflow (Pros/Cons + Constraints)

## What You'll Accomplish
By the end of this workflow, you'll have a structured approach to making decisions. You'll learn to lay out options, list pros and cons, consider constraints, and reach a well-reasoned conclusion. You'll also see how an AI assistant can help identify considerations you might have overlooked.

## Who This Is For
This workflow is for anyone facing a decision and wanting a methodical way to think it through. It's especially useful if you:
- Feel stuck choosing between two or more options.
- Make decisions impulsively and later regret them.
- Want to document your reasoning for important choices.
- Need to explain your decision to others.

## Inputs
- **The decision:** Clearly state what you're deciding between.
- **Options:** The choices available to you.
- **Context:** Relevant background, constraints, and priorities.
- **(Optional) AI assistant:** To help brainstorm pros/cons and challenge your thinking.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Decision
Write out the decision you're facing in clear terms. What exactly are you choosing between? Having a precise question helps focus your analysis.

Example: "Should I accept the job offer at Company B, or stay at my current company?"

### Step 2: List Your Options
Identify all available options. Usually there are more than two:
- Accept the new job
- Stay at current job
- Negotiate different terms
- Keep looking for other opportunities

Don't artificially limit yourself to binary choices.

### Step 3: Identify Your Criteria and Constraints
What factors matter most in this decision? List them:
- Salary and benefits
- Work-life balance
- Career growth potential
- Location and commute
- Company culture

Also note constraints – things that are non-negotiable or limit your options (e.g., "I can't relocate" or "I need health insurance").

### Step 4: Create a Pros/Cons List for Each Option
For each option, list:
- **Pros:** Benefits, advantages, what you gain
- **Cons:** Drawbacks, disadvantages, what you lose or risk

Be thorough. Include both practical and emotional factors.

### Step 5: Use AI to Expand Your Thinking (Optional)
Share your decision and initial pros/cons with an AI: "I'm deciding between [options]. Here are my pros and cons: [list]. What am I missing? What other factors should I consider?"

The AI might point out:
- Considerations you overlooked
- Long-term implications
- Questions you should ask before deciding

### Step 6: Weight Your Criteria
Not all factors matter equally. If salary is most important, give it more weight. You can do this formally (assign 1-10 scores) or informally (just keep your priorities in mind as you review).

### Step 7: Consider the Worst-Case Scenario
For each option, ask: "What's the worst that could happen?" And then: "Could I recover from that?" This helps put risks in perspective.

### Step 8: Make the Decision
Based on your analysis, choose the option that best aligns with your priorities and constraints. Trust your process – you've done the work to think it through.

### Step 9: Document Your Reasoning
Write down why you made this choice. This helps if you second-guess yourself later, and it's useful for learning from your decision-making over time.

### Step 10: Act and Commit
Once decided, move forward. Avoid endless reconsideration. Make the best decision you can with available information, then execute.

## Prompt Templates
- "I'm trying to decide between [Option A] and [Option B]. Here are the pros and cons I've identified: [list]. What factors am I overlooking?"
- "Help me think through this decision: [describe decision]. What questions should I be asking myself?"
- "I've narrowed down to two job offers. Here are the details: [details]. Which factors should I weigh most heavily for long-term career success?"
- "Play devil's advocate: I'm leaning toward [choice]. What are the best arguments against it?"
- "I made a decision to [choice] but I'm second-guessing myself. Help me evaluate whether I made the right call based on: [reasoning]."

## Example Output

**Decision:** Should I take the remote job offer or stay at my current in-office position?

**Options:**
1. Accept remote job at new company
2. Stay at current in-office job
3. Ask current employer for remote option

**Criteria (weighted):**
- Salary (High importance)
- Work-life balance (High)
- Career growth (Medium)
- Team/culture (Medium)
- Job security (Medium)

**Option 1: Remote Job**
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| 20% higher salary | Unknown company culture |
| Full remote flexibility | Less mentorship opportunity |
| New industry exposure | Startup – less stability |
| No commute | May feel isolated |

**Option 2: Current Job**
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Known, comfortable | Salary plateaued |
| Good relationships | 1-hour commute daily |
| Stable company | Limited growth ceiling |
| In-person collaboration | Rigid schedule |

**Decision:** After weighing criteria, the remote job aligns better with priorities (higher salary, better work-life balance). Concerns about culture can be mitigated by asking for a trial period.

## Common Mistakes
- **Analysis paralysis:** Spending too long deciding. Set a deadline and commit.
- **Ignoring emotions:** Gut feelings matter. If something feels wrong despite looking good on paper, explore why.
- **Confirmation bias:** Only seeing pros for your preferred option. Actively look for cons too.
- **Not considering doing nothing:** Sometimes the best choice is to wait or maintain status quo.
- **Overcomplicating:** For small decisions, trust your instincts. Save deep analysis for significant choices.
- **Forgetting constraints:** Make sure your chosen option is actually feasible given your constraints.
