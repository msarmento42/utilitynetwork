# Inbox Zero / Message Triage Workflow

## What You'll Accomplish
By the end of this workflow, you'll have a systematic process for managing your inbox, aiming for "inbox zero" – or at least a manageable, organized inbox. You'll learn to quickly triage incoming messages, decide what needs action, and use AI to help summarize or categorize emails so you can focus on what matters most.

## Who This Is For
This workflow is for anyone drowning in emails or messages. It's especially useful if you:
- Have hundreds of unread emails and don't know where to start.
- Spend too much time on email instead of actual work.
- Often miss important messages buried in noise.
- Want a repeatable system for staying on top of communications.

## Inputs
- **Your inbox:** Access to your email (or other message platform) with pending messages.
- **Clear action categories:** Understanding of how you'll sort messages (e.g., action required, read later, archive, delete).
- **(Optional) AI assistant:** A tool to help summarize long emails or suggest categorization.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Set Up Your System
Before diving in, establish your categories. Common ones include:
- **Action Required:** Emails needing a response or task from you.
- **Waiting For:** Emails where you're waiting on someone else.
- **Read/Review:** Newsletters, FYI emails to read when you have time.
- **Archive:** Emails you might need later but require no action.
- **Delete/Unsubscribe:** Spam, irrelevant emails, or newsletters you never read.

Create folders or labels for these in your email client.

### Step 2: Process from Top to Bottom
Start at the top of your inbox and work down. For each email, make a quick decision:
- **Can I respond in 2 minutes or less?** Do it now and archive.
- **Does it require more time?** Move to "Action Required" folder.
- **Am I waiting on someone?** Move to "Waiting For."
- **Is it just informational?** Move to "Read/Review" or archive.
- **Is it junk?** Delete or unsubscribe.

The goal is to touch each email once and move it out of your inbox.

### Step 3: Use AI to Summarize Long Emails (Optional)
For lengthy emails or email threads, paste the content into an AI assistant and ask: "Summarize this email in 2-3 sentences and identify any action items for me." This saves reading time and helps you quickly understand what's needed.

### Step 4: Batch Similar Actions
Instead of constantly switching between tasks:
- Process all emails first, categorizing them.
- Then handle all "quick responses" together.
- Schedule time for longer action items.
- Batch-read newsletters during downtime.

### Step 5: Schedule Email Time
Don't live in your inbox. Schedule specific times for email (e.g., 9am, 1pm, 5pm). Outside those times, close your email and focus on other work. This prevents constant interruption.

### Step 6: Maintain Daily
Spend 15-30 minutes at the end of each day clearing your inbox. If you process emails regularly, it won't pile up again.

### Step 7: Weekly Review
Once a week, review your "Waiting For" and "Action Required" folders. Follow up on anything that's stalled. Archive anything that's been resolved.

## Prompt Templates
- "Summarize this email thread in 3 bullet points and tell me what action I need to take: [paste email]"
- "I have 50 unread emails. Here are their subject lines: [list subjects]. Which ones likely need urgent attention based on the subjects?"
- "Help me draft a quick response to this email: [paste email]. Keep it professional and under 3 sentences."
- "I'm trying to achieve inbox zero. What strategies do you suggest for someone who gets 100+ emails per day?"

## Example Output

**Email 1:** "Q4 Budget Review Meeting" → Action Required (need to prepare and attend)
**Email 2:** "Newsletter: Weekly Tech Digest" → Read/Review (batch for lunch reading)
**Email 3:** "RE: Project Status Update" → Archive (FYI only, no action needed)
**Email 4:** "URGENT: Client Issue" → Action Required (respond immediately)
**Email 5:** "Promotional offer from random vendor" → Delete/Unsubscribe

*Result: Inbox cleared, with 2 items in Action Required folder to handle today.*

## Common Mistakes
- **Leaving emails in the inbox without deciding:** If you read an email and leave it, you'll re-read it later – wasting time.
- **Not having a system:** Without folders or categories, emails pile up with no clear path to zero.
- **Treating every email as urgent:** Most emails can wait. Prioritize ruthlessly.
- **Checking email constantly:** Each check is a context switch. Batch your email processing instead.
- **Not unsubscribing:** If you never read certain newsletters, unsubscribe. Reduce incoming volume.
- **Using AI without privacy caution:** Don't paste sensitive or confidential emails into AI tools. Use AI for general messages only.

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] You have clear categories/folders set up.
- [ ] Each email is processed and moved out of the inbox.
- [ ] Quick responses are done immediately.
- [ ] Longer action items are scheduled.
- [ ] You've scheduled specific email times rather than checking constantly.
- [ ] Weekly review of "Waiting For" and "Action Required" is on your calendar.
