# Recurring Chores/Admin Automation Checklist

## What You'll Accomplish
By the end of this workflow, you'll have a system for managing recurring tasks – those routine chores and administrative duties that pop up daily, weekly, or monthly. You'll reduce mental load by externalizing these tasks to a checklist and explore ways to automate or streamline them with AI assistance.

## Who This Is For
This workflow is for anyone feeling overwhelmed by the small recurring tasks that pile up. It's especially useful if you:
- Forget routine tasks until they become urgent (paying bills, scheduling appointments).
- Spend mental energy remembering what needs to be done regularly.
- Want to automate or delegate repetitive admin work.
- Have both home and work recurring tasks to manage.

## Inputs
- **List of recurring tasks:** Everything you need to do regularly – daily, weekly, monthly, or annually.
- **Task management tool:** A to-do app with recurring task features, or a simple checklist.
- **Automation tools (optional):** Apps like IFTTT, Zapier, or built-in automations on your devices.
- **(Optional) AI assistant:** To help identify automatable tasks and create reminders.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Brain Dump All Recurring Tasks
Write down every recurring task you can think of:

**Daily:** Make bed, check email, review calendar, take vitamins
**Weekly:** Laundry, grocery shopping, team status meeting, review budget
**Monthly:** Pay rent, reconcile accounts, backup computer, HVAC filter
**Quarterly/Annually:** File taxes, renew subscriptions, schedule checkups

Don't filter – just capture everything.

### Step 2: Categorize Tasks
Group tasks by:
- **Frequency:** Daily, weekly, monthly, etc.
- **Area:** Home, work, health, finance, etc.
- **Type:** Can be automated, needs human action, can be delegated

### Step 3: Set Up Recurring Reminders
Add each task to your task management system with appropriate recurrence:
- Use apps that support recurring tasks (Todoist, Microsoft To-Do, Apple Reminders)
- Set reminders for the right time (e.g., "Pay rent" reminder on the 25th of each month)
- Include just enough detail to take action immediately

### Step 4: Identify Automation Opportunities
For each task, ask: "Can this be automated or made easier?"

Examples:
- **Auto-pay bills:** Set up automatic payments so you don't have to remember.
- **Auto-order supplies:** Subscribe to recurring deliveries (household items, pet food).
- **Calendar blocks:** Automatically block time for weekly reviews or admin tasks.
- **Email filters:** Auto-sort routine emails into folders.
- **Template messages:** Create templates for repetitive emails or reports.

### Step 5: Use AI to Streamline (Optional)
AI can help with recurring tasks:
- "Remind me to [task] every [frequency]"
- "Draft a template email I can use for weekly status updates"
- "What recurring tasks are commonly forgotten? Help me make sure my list is complete."
- "Suggest ways to automate these tasks: [list tasks]"

### Step 6: Create Checklists for Complex Recurring Tasks
For tasks with multiple steps, create a checklist so you don't have to think through them each time.

Example: Monthly Financial Review Checklist
- [ ] Download bank statements
- [ ] Categorize transactions
- [ ] Review budget vs. actual
- [ ] Check for unusual charges
- [ ] Update tracking spreadsheet
- [ ] Set next month's budget

### Step 7: Delegate Where Possible
Some recurring tasks can be delegated:
- Hire a cleaner for house chores
- Use a virtual assistant for scheduling
- Automate report generation and have AI summarize results

### Step 8: Review and Refine Monthly
Once a month, review your recurring tasks:
- Are reminders set correctly?
- Any tasks that can now be automated?
- Any new recurring tasks to add?
- Any tasks no longer relevant to remove?

## Prompt Templates
- "Here are my recurring tasks: [list]. Which ones could be automated, and how?"
- "Help me create a checklist for my monthly [task, e.g., budget review]. What steps should be included?"
- "I need to remember to do [task] every [frequency]. Write a reminder message that tells me exactly what to do."
- "What recurring administrative tasks do most people forget? Help me audit my list."
- "Draft a template I can use for [recurring email, e.g., weekly team update]."

## Example Output

**Recurring Task Automation Analysis**

| Task | Frequency | Automation Possibility |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| Pay rent | Monthly | Auto-pay set up ✓ |
| Grocery shopping | Weekly | Use delivery service with saved list |
| Review weekly calendar | Weekly | Block 15 min Sunday evening |
| Backup computer | Monthly | Auto-backup to cloud enabled ✓ |
| Order pet food | Monthly | Auto-subscribe delivery ✓ |
| Update team on progress | Weekly | Template email created |
| Check smoke detectors | 6 months | Calendar reminder set |

**Status:** 4 of 7 tasks automated. Remaining tasks have reminders and templates.

## Common Mistakes
- **Relying on memory:** The whole point is to externalize tasks. Put them in a system.
- **Over-automating:** Some tasks need human judgment. Don't automate things that require review.
- **Setting and forgetting:** Review your recurring tasks periodically. Life changes.
- **Too many reminders:** If you get alert fatigue, consolidate tasks (e.g., "Sunday admin block" for multiple small tasks).
- **Not including enough detail:** "Do finances" isn't helpful. Be specific: "Reconcile checking account."
- **Ignoring the task anyway:** Having a reminder is useless if you keep snoozing it. If you're always snoozing a task, reevaluate whether it's necessary or if the timing is wrong.

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] All recurring tasks are captured in a system.
- [ ] Tasks have appropriate frequencies and reminder times.
- [ ] Automation is set up for tasks that support it.
- [ ] Complex tasks have step-by-step checklists.
- [ ] Templates exist for repetitive communications.
- [ ] Monthly review of recurring tasks is scheduled.
