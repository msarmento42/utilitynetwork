# Prioritization Workflow (Urgent/Important Matrix)

## What You'll Accomplish
By the end of this workflow, you'll have a clear system for deciding which tasks to tackle first. Using the Urgent/Important matrix (also known as the Eisenhower Matrix), you'll categorize your to-dos into four quadrants: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and neither. This helps you focus your energy on high-impact work and avoid wasting time on low-priority distractions.

## Who This Is For
This workflow is ideal for anyone who feels overwhelmed by their task list or struggles to decide what to work on next. It's especially helpful if you:
- Have too many competing priorities and don't know where to start.
- Often find yourself firefighting urgent tasks while important projects languish.
- Want a systematic way to evaluate tasks rather than going by gut feeling.

## Inputs
- **Your task list:** All pending tasks, deadlines, and commitments you need to evaluate.
- **Understanding of deadlines:** Know which tasks have hard deadlines and which are flexible.
- **(Optional) AI assistant:** A chatbot like ChatGPT to help you categorize tasks or challenge your assumptions about priority.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: List All Your Tasks
Write down every task you need to accomplish. Include work projects, personal errands, appointments, and anything else on your mind. Don't worry about order yet – just get everything out of your head and onto paper or a digital list.

### Step 2: Understand the Four Quadrants
The Eisenhower Matrix divides tasks into four categories:
- **Quadrant 1 (Urgent + Important):** Crisis tasks, deadlines, emergencies. Do these immediately.
- **Quadrant 2 (Important + Not Urgent):** Planning, relationship building, personal development. Schedule time for these – they're high-value.
- **Quadrant 3 (Urgent + Not Important):** Interruptions, some meetings, some emails. Delegate if possible or batch together.
- **Quadrant 4 (Not Urgent + Not Important):** Time-wasters, busywork. Eliminate or minimize these.

### Step 3: Categorize Each Task
Go through your list and assign each task to a quadrant. Ask yourself:
- Is this task urgent? (Does it have a deadline soon or require immediate attention?)
- Is this task important? (Does it contribute to my goals, values, or long-term success?)

Be honest – many tasks feel urgent but aren't truly important.

### Step 4: Use AI to Challenge Your Categorization (Optional)
Paste your categorized list into an AI assistant and ask: "Review my task prioritization. Am I categorizing anything incorrectly? Are there tasks I'm treating as urgent that might not be?" The AI might spot tasks you've overvalued or suggest moving something to a different quadrant.

### Step 5: Create Your Action Plan
Based on your quadrants:
- **Q1 tasks:** Do these today or as soon as possible.
- **Q2 tasks:** Schedule specific time blocks for these (see our [Time Blocking workflow](/productivity/time-blocking-weekly-planning/)).
- **Q3 tasks:** Delegate, batch together, or set strict time limits.
- **Q4 tasks:** Consider eliminating entirely or doing only if all else is done.

### Step 6: Review and Adjust Regularly
Priorities change. At the start of each week (or day), quickly review your matrix. New tasks may need to be added and categorized. Some tasks may shift quadrants as deadlines approach.

## Prompt Templates
- "Here is my task list: [list tasks]. Categorize each task into the Eisenhower Matrix quadrants (Urgent/Important, Important/Not Urgent, Urgent/Not Important, Neither)."
- "I've categorized my tasks as follows: [your categorization]. As a productivity coach, do you agree with my assessment? What might I be misjudging?"
- "Help me prioritize: I have 15 tasks to do this week. Which ones should I focus on first, and which can wait? Here are the tasks: [list]."
- "I keep getting pulled into urgent but unimportant tasks. How can I protect my time for important work?"

## Example Output

| Task | Urgent? | Important? | Quadrant |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| Finish client proposal (due tomorrow) | Yes | Yes | Q1 – Do First |
| Plan next quarter's strategy | No | Yes | Q2 – Schedule |
| Reply to routine emails | Yes | No | Q3 – Batch/Delegate |
| Scroll social media | No | No | Q4 – Eliminate |
| Prepare presentation (due next week) | No | Yes | Q2 – Schedule |
| Fix urgent bug in production | Yes | Yes | Q1 – Do First |

## Common Mistakes
- **Treating everything as urgent:** If everything is urgent, nothing is. Be ruthless about what truly needs immediate attention.
- **Neglecting Quadrant 2:** Important but not urgent tasks (like planning, learning, relationship building) get pushed aside. These are often the most valuable activities for long-term success.
- **Confusing other people's urgency with your own:** Just because someone else wants something now doesn't make it important to your goals.
- **Not revisiting priorities:** Your matrix isn't static. Review it regularly as new tasks come in and circumstances change.
- **Over-categorizing:** Don't spend more time organizing than doing. A quick categorization is better than perfect analysis.

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] All tasks are listed and accounted for.
- [ ] Each task is honestly evaluated for urgency AND importance.
- [ ] Q1 tasks have specific action times assigned.
- [ ] Q2 tasks are scheduled in your calendar.
- [ ] Q3 tasks are delegated, batched, or time-limited.
- [ ] Q4 tasks are eliminated or deprioritized.
