## 1. What you’ll accomplish

In this workflow, you’ll use AI to **customize your resume for a specific job posting**. The result will be a resume that highlights exactly the skills and experiences the employer is looking for. AI can help you rephrase bullet points or summaries to include key words and match the job’s language, making your resume more relevant to the role. By the end, your resume will reflect the job description’s priorities without stretching the truth – improving your chances of catching a recruiter’s eye and passing any automated filters.

## 2. Who this is for / when to use it

This guide is for anyone applying to specific job openings. It’s especially useful when you have multiple applications: instead of sending one generic resume, you’ll adapt it for each role. It’s also for career-changers or graduates whose general experience may not obviously match the new field: you’ll learn to emphasize transferable skills. Use this workflow **after** you find a job posting you want to apply to, and before you send your application. You should have a base resume ready (your most recent version) to modify.

## 3. Inputs you need

- **Job description text:** Copy the full text of the job posting (listing responsibilities and qualifications). We’ll use this to spot the important keywords and requirements.
- **Your current resume:** A draft of your resume (in text form) that you can edit. Having it in a text format (like Word or Google Docs) makes it easier for AI to process.
- **Your career highlights:** A list of your skills, accomplishments, and metrics. (If you don’t have this already, you can quickly list major projects, roles, certifications, etc.) This helps AI craft strong bullet points.
- **AI assistant:** Any LLM/chatbot (for example, ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, etc.). We’re giving example prompts below, but you can use your preferred AI system.
- **Optional:** Your target job title or company, to help personalize the resume. Sometimes including the job title in your summary shows you’ve tailored the resume.

## 4. Step-by-step workflow

1. **Analyze the job description.** Read the posting carefully. Highlight or list the key **skills, requirements, and responsibilities** mentioned. Note repeated keywords (e.g. “project management,” “Python,” “customer service”) and the order they appear. Indeed’s career advice suggests mirroring the employer’s priorities – for instance, if leadership is listed first, start your bullets with leadership examples.
2. **Identify your matching experience.** Look over your resume and career highlights. Pick out the experiences, tasks, and achievements that align with those key terms. Decide what is most relevant. For example, if the job emphasizes teamwork and results, you might pick a project where you led a team and improved a metric.
3. **Use AI to rephrase bullets.** For each relevant experience, use AI to incorporate the job’s keywords. For example, you might feed AI a bullet from your resume and the keyword, asking it to rewrite the sentence. This makes sure you use similar phrasing. For instance, if your original bullet says “led a team” and the JD mentions “team leadership,” your AI prompt could be:
   > *Prompt:* *“Rewrite this bullet to include ‘team leadership’: Led a team of 5 to redesign the workflow, improving efficiency.”*
   AI might output: “Led a team of five in redesigning the workflow, demonstrating strong team leadership and improving efficiency.”
   Repeat this for several bullets, focusing on integrating keywords naturally.
4. **Update your summary or headline.** If your resume has a summary/objective at the top, use it to mention the job title or main skill. Example: If applying for “Digital Marketing Manager,” your summary could begin “Digital Marketing Manager with 3+ years experience….” You can ask AI: “Based on these keywords [list some] and this summary [paste your draft], rewrite it to show alignment.” This signals to the recruiter (and any ATS) that your resume is tailored to *that* position.
5. **Proofread and adjust.** Compare the AI-generated text to your real experience. Ensure nothing is exaggerated or false. Indeed cautions that tailored resumes should use specific language from the job description, but you must still **only include things you actually did**. Read through each sentence: if a bullet says you achieved something you didn’t, remove or fix it. Also check spelling and grammar. You can even run the AI again with a prompt like “Check this bullet for clarity and honesty,” but always double-check manually.
6. **Finalize formatting.** Once the content is tailored, make sure the layout is still clean. Keep sections like “Skills” or “Education” but reorder them if needed (place the most relevant experiences first). Save the resume in the preferred format (often Word or PDF) as specified by the job listing.

## 5. Prompt templates

- **Keyword Integration:**
  *Prompt:* “Rewrite this resume bullet to include the keyword ‘[KeySkill]’ naturally.”
  *Purpose:* To ensure the important skill appears exactly as in the job description.
  *Customization:* Replace `[KeySkill]` with a term from the job posting (e.g. *“data analysis”*). Then paste your existing bullet. Ask AI to keep the meaning but include the word.

- **Summary Alignment:**
  *Prompt:* “Here’s my resume summary and the job title I’m applying for. Please rewrite the summary to emphasize that title and include the keywords [list] from the job description.”
  *Purpose:* To customize the top of your resume for the specific role.
  *Customization:* Add the actual job title and any top 3 keywords you found (like skills or qualifications). Provide your current summary and job title as context.

- **Experience Matching:**
  *Prompt:* “Given the following job description excerpt, suggest how I might describe my experience in bullet points. Job description: [paste key part]. My experience: [briefly describe your role].”
  *Purpose:* To get ideas for bullet content aligned with the JD.
  *Customization:* Include a sentence or two about a relevant past job, and a snippet of the JD that matches that experience. AI will try to produce one or two bullet points.

- **Quantify Impact:**
  *Prompt:* “Turn this resume line into one that includes a measurable result: [your current bullet]”
  *Purpose:* To add data and numbers, which hiring managers love (and AI can help articulate).
  *Customization:* Use any measurable details you have (e.g. percentages, money, time savings). If the AI suggests an achievement, verify it was something real you did.

*(Each prompt above assumes you’ll replace placeholders with your own info. Work with the AI as a collaborator: refine the prompts if the first output isn’t perfect, and iterate until it fits your actual experience.)*

## 6. Example output

Let’s say the job description emphasizes “project management” and “Agile methodology,” and your original bullet is:
- “Managed software development process for internal tools.”

An AI rewrite might produce:
- “Managed software development projects using Agile methodologies, improving delivery speed by 20%.”

Notice that it inserted “Agile methodologies” and added a result. Always confirm that “20%” came from something you actually measured.

## 7. Ethics note

**Be honest.** Use AI suggestions as a **draft**, not a final answer. Never fabricate experiences or inflate your role. For example, don’t claim you led a team when you didn’t. The MIT career center warns against bending the truth in interviews or resumes. If the AI prompts you to include a skill you don’t have, skip it.

Use respectful, inclusive language. Focus on your qualifications, not personal characteristics irrelevant to the job. And follow each employer’s instructions: if they say “no editing of resumes on file,” don’t. Remember: AI can help you reword *your actual facts*; it should not replace your integrity.

## 8. Common mistakes & how to fix

- **Keyword overstuffing:** Don’t cram irrelevant keywords. If you force many keywords, sentences become unnatural. Instead, use only those that truly match your experience. If you add a keyword, double-check it fits logically.
- **Vague phrases:** “Responsible for” is weak. If AI gives a generic result, refine it. For example, change “responsible for sales” to “drove $X in sales.”
- **Missing specifics:** If a bullet is generic, ask AI to add detail. But ensure it comes from you. E.g. if AI says “improved customer satisfaction,” you should have evidence.
- **Not mirroring priorities:** Perhaps you put some skills lower in your resume even though the JD lists them first. Indeed suggests mirroring priorities (what employer lists first, you list early). Check your order.
- **Typos/formatting errors:** Always proofread the AI output. AI models can make spelling mistakes or use inconsistent formatting. Use your own eyes or a grammar tool to clean it up.

If you notice a problem, iterate. Don’t accept the first AI response if it’s off-target. For example, if the AI inserts a fictitious achievement, correct it. If it uses too casual a tone, prompt it to be more professional.

## 9. Quality checklist

-   Did I use key terms from the job description in my resume (especially in the summary, skills, and bullet points)?
-   Are my most relevant experiences and skills listed first on the resume (mirroring the job’s top priorities)?
-   Did I quantify achievements where possible (use numbers or clear outcomes)?
-   Is all information accurate and verifiable (no invented roles or metrics)?
-   Did I proofread for grammar and clarity after using AI (AI can introduce errors)?
-   Is the resume format simple and ATS-friendly (no images, tables, or unusual fonts)?
-   Does the resume still read like *you* – authentic and honest?
