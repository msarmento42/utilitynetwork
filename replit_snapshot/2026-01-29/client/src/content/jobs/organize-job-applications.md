## 1. What you’ll accomplish

By following this workflow, you’ll set up a **system to track your job applications** efficiently. You’ll learn how to log each application’s details (company, role, date applied, status, etc.) and use AI tools to keep reminders and notes. AI can help automate updates or suggest prioritization, so you don’t lose sight of any opportunity. The result will be a clear overview of your job search pipeline, saving you time and stress.

## 2. Who this is for / when to use it

If you’re applying to multiple jobs (which most job seekers do), tracking everything by memory can be chaotic. This is for you if you want to avoid missing deadlines, forget sending follow-ups, or applying to the same company twice. It’s useful for anyone managing a job search: recent graduates, career switchers, and any active job seeker. Start this as soon as you begin applying, and update it each time you submit or hear back on an application.

## 3. Inputs you need

- **Job details:** For each application: company name, job title, date you applied, recruiter name (if any), and application link or email.
- **Application statuses:** Current status (e.g., Applied, Interviewing, Offer, Rejected).
- **Deadlines and dates:** Any deadlines (application close, interview dates) and follow-up dates.
- **Notes:** Space to jot down contact info or interview feedback.
- **AI assistant or tracking tool:** You can use spreadsheet software or a job-tracking app. AI can help fill out or organize data.

## 4. Step-by-step workflow

1. **Choose a tracking method.** This could be a simple spreadsheet, a notebook, or a specialized app. Tools like Google Sheets are free and flexible, or you might use a tool like Trello or Notion. The key is one place to store all applications. If using AI, some tools offer AI-driven features; otherwise, you can prompt AI to help manage the spreadsheet.
2. **Set up columns/fields.** Typical fields: Company, Job Title, Date Applied, Application Link, Contact Person, Status, Follow-up Date, Notes. If AI suggests additional useful fields, consider those too. For example, you might add “Keywords from Job” to remind yourself of tailor notes. Some job-search tools (like Teal) extract keywords automatically, so you can emulate that by copying key skills for each job.
3. **Log your first applications.** For each job you apply to, enter the details immediately. If using a spreadsheet, you could have an AI prompt like *“Add a new row with these details: [list of details].”* (Some AI tools can interact with spreadsheets.) If manual, make it a habit: every time you click apply, stop and enter the data.
4. **Use AI for reminders.** If you have an AI calendar or assistant, you can say: *“Remind me to follow up on [Company Name] application on [Date].”* Or if using a sheet, let AI scan it and highlight upcoming follow-ups. The idea is to automate the tedious part: Teal’s FAQs mention that a job tracker “automates the tedious job search process” and keeps information organized. You can mimic this with your calendar or to-do app.
5. **Update statuses regularly.** Whenever there’s movement (interview scheduled, offer received, or rejection), log it. This helps you see where you stand. If you get an interview invite, change the status to “Interviewing” and note the date. If a deadline passes, note it. AI can help by summarizing updates: try prompts like *“Summarize the current status of my job search given this list of applications.”* to get an overview if you have many entries.
6. **Review and prioritize.** Periodically (weekly, for example), review your tracker. Use AI to help prioritize: *“Given these job entries [list 3-5 entries], which should I follow up on first?”* This can help you focus on high-impact opportunities. You might consider criteria like deadline proximity or how well you fit the job. Adjust your follow-up dates or notes accordingly.

## 5. Prompt templates

- **Add job application:**
  *Prompt:* “Create a new entry for this job application: Company [Name], Role [Title], Applied on [Date], Status [Applied].”
  *Purpose:* To ensure you format and store new application info consistently.
  *Customization:* Use your chosen tool (if AI-integrated) or just copy-paste a consistent line into your tracker.

- **Follow-up reminder:**
  *Prompt:* “I applied to [Company] on [Date] and haven’t heard back. Draft a follow-up email reminder.”
  *Purpose:* To handle candidates who want to send a nudge email after a waiting period.
  *Customization:* This generates a polite follow-up email. You may adapt it as per our email guide. The tracker helps identify whom and when to follow up with.

- **Progress summary:**
  *Prompt:* “Review my job applications: [list a few jobs and statuses]. Which ones need follow-up soon?”
  *Purpose:* To quickly identify urgent tasks.
  *Customization:* Paste entries from your tracker, e.g. “Company A – interviewing (May 1), Company B – applied (no response)”. AI can suggest next steps (like follow-ups or thank-you notes).

- **Skills matching (for fun):**
  *Prompt:* “Given these applications [brief list of job titles], suggest any key skills I should have listed on my resume to match them.”
  *Purpose:* To check if you’re tracking the right keywords for each job.
  *Customization:* Name a couple of positions; AI will list common requirements you might have missed.

*(Some AI tools might integrate directly with spreadsheets or task apps. If not, use these prompts in a note-taking app or chat during your weekly review to keep you on track.)*

## 6. Example output

Let’s say you have applied to:
- “Acme Corp – Engineer (Applied 2025-10-01, Status: Applied)”
- “Beta LLC – Analyst (Applied 2025-09-28, Status: Interview Scheduled 2025-10-05)”

**AI summary:**
“You have 2 active applications: The interview for Beta LLC is coming up on 2025-10-05 – prepare accordingly. For Acme Corp, since it’s been 5 days, consider sending a polite follow-up email this week to confirm receipt of your application.”

This kind of check helps ensure timely action on each entry.

## 7. Ethics note

Be careful with personal data. If your tracker contains contact info (emails, phone numbers) or notes, store it securely. If you use an AI tool, make sure it’s a trusted one; some AI may log data. Don’t publicly share sensitive information from your tracker.

Also, avoid sending mass, generic messages just because you have lots of entries. Each follow-up or email should still be personalized. AI can help draft text, but not to spam.

Finally, organizing your applications does not guarantee success – use this to make your search efficient, not as a substitute for effort. Don’t rely entirely on AI automation: double-check everything before acting.

## 8. Common mistakes & how to fix

- **Neglecting the tracker:** Failing to log entries consistently. **Fix:** Make it a routine part of applying: immediately after you submit an application, pause and log it. You could even put a note in your calendar.
- **Messy or duplicate entries:** Accidentally duplicating or messing up the formatting. **Fix:** Keep a clean format (AI can help summarize duplicates). If two entries look the same, double-check if you re-applied or if it’s the same job.
- **No follow-up plan:** Recording a job and then forgetting it. **Fix:** Use the calendar or a reminder tool. For example, set an automated reminder 1–2 weeks after you log a new application. Some trackers (or smart to-do apps) allow recurring reminders.
- **Cluttered notes:** Writing unclear notes about each application. **Fix:** Make concise notes (date of contact, names). If AI suggests a shorthand, clarify it. Keep only actionable information.

If the AI suggests automation (like connecting your email to auto-log applications), ensure you’re comfortable with data sharing. Otherwise, simple manual updates are fine.

## 9. Quality checklist

-   Is every job application I applied to recorded in the tracker?
-   For each entry, have I included a **status** (e.g. Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected)?
-   Did I set next steps or follow-up dates where applicable?
-   Are important dates (interviews, deadlines) noted?
-   Do I regularly (at least once a week) review and update this tracker?
-   Have I backed up the tracker or made it accessible on multiple devices?
-   Are all job postings’ key details (Company, Role, Location) correct and up-to-date?

Use this checklist each week to audit your tracking. Keeping it accurate means no opportunity is forgotten.

## 11. Disclaimer

This guide is for managing information only. We don’t guarantee that organizing your jobs leads to more interviews. Use any tool (AI or not) in a way you’re comfortable with – keeping privacy and security in mind. If using an AI tool that stores data, be aware of how that data is used. The quality of your job applications also depends on their content and the job market, not just on tracking.
