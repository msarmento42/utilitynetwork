## 1. What you’ll accomplish

This workflow teaches you how to write professional outreach emails with the help of AI. Whether you’re applying for a job, following up on an interview, or networking with a recruiter, the AI prompts and tips here will help you create clear subject lines, polite greetings, concise bodies, and proper closings. You’ll end up with emails that highlight your qualifications and interest respectfully, and that follow best practices (like correct formatting and mentioning attachments).

## 2. Who this is for / when to use it

Anyone who needs to send a job-related email can benefit. This includes sending an email application or cover letter, writing a thank-you note after an interview, or reaching out to a hiring manager or recruiter. Use this guide whenever you draft a professional job-seeking email. Before applying or after a conversation, follow these steps to ensure your email makes a strong, positive impression.

## 3. Inputs you need

- **Purpose of the email:** Be clear if it’s an application, follow-up, introduction, etc. This will guide the tone.
- **Recipient info:** Name and title of the person (if available), and their email address.
- **Your resume or content:** Any key points you want to include (like how your background fits the role, or the date of your interview).
- **Attachments:** A copy of your resume and cover letter (if needed).
- **AI assistant:** To help formulate and polish the text.

## 4. Step-by-step workflow

1. **Set up your subject line.** The subject should be concise and informative. AI can suggest good options. For example:
*“John Doe – Application for Marketing Coordinator (Req. 1234)”* is clearer than “Job Application.” Indeed specifically recommends including your name and job title in the subject. Try prompts like *“Suggest 3 subject line ideas for applying to [Job Title]”*. Pick the one that’s straightforward and matches any instructions from the job posting.
2. **Write a greeting.** Begin with a formal salutation using the recipient’s name: “Dear Ms. Smith,” or “Hello Dr. Lee,”. If you don’t have a name, “Hello,” or “Greetings,” is acceptable. Avoid “To whom it may concern,” since AI suggests addressing by name whenever possible. If AI doesn’t know the name, ensure you find it from LinkedIn or the company website – this personal touch helps.
3. **Compose the body.** In one or two short paragraphs, introduce yourself and state the purpose. If it’s a job application email, mention the position title and where you found it. Use AI to help with phrasing: for example, *“Write a brief opening for a job application email for a [Job Title] at [Company].”* Include a sentence or two highlighting a key qualification or interest. For instance: “As a marketing graduate with experience in social media campaigns, I am excited to apply for the Marketing Coordinator role.” Keep it focused. Indeed advises stating the reason for writing and summarizing your fit early.
4. **Attach your documents.** If this email is accompanying a resume or cover letter, mention the attachments: “I have attached my resume and cover letter for your review.” and ensure the files are correctly attached with clear filenames (e.g., “John_Doe_Resume.pdf”). Do this before any sign-off line. Check indeed’s steps: they advise confirming attachments are added.
5. **Add a polite closing.** Thank the reader for their time and indicate your next steps. For instance: “Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing my background. I am available at your convenience.” Then sign off with “Sincerely,” or “Best regards,” followed by your full name and contact info. Indeed also suggests including your contact info in the signature.
6. **Proofread thoroughly.** Finally, review for errors. AI can help check grammar, but also read it yourself or have a friend scan it. Indeed recommends sending a test email to yourself to see how it looks. Make sure your tone stays professional and friendly. Avoid overly casual language or emojis. Confirm the email address and spelling of names one last time.

## 5. Prompt templates

- **Email draft:**
  *Prompt:* “Draft a concise professional email for a job application: I’m applying for [Job Title] at [Company]. Mention my interest and attach resume.”
  *Purpose:* To get a complete email body, including subject and sign-off.
  *Customization:* Fill in the job title and company. You can then edit the AI’s draft to add specific details or your voice.

- **Subject line ideas:**
  *Prompt:* “Generate 3 subject lines for an email applying to [Job Title]. Include the applicant’s name.”
  *Purpose:* To craft a clear subject.
  *Customization:* Provide your name and title. AI will suggest short but informative subjects (e.g., “Jane Doe – [Job Title] Application”).

- **Tone/formality check:**
  *Prompt:* “Check this email for tone and politeness: [paste your draft email].”
  *Purpose:* To ensure the email reads politely.
  *Customization:* Copy your email body. AI will point out any overly informal phrasing or suggest more courteous language.

- **Follow-up email:**
  *Prompt:* “Write a follow-up email if I haven’t heard back about my [Job Title] application after 1 week.”
  *Purpose:* To have a template ready for polite checking in.
  *Customization:* Insert the role and timeframe. The AI will typically create a short note expressing continued interest and asking for any updates.

*(After using AI, always read the email carefully. Replace any placeholders or AI guesses (like company names or details) with your actual information.)*

## 6. Example output

**Subject:** “Alex Kim – Sales Associate Application” (clear and includes name and position).
**Email body (AI-assisted):**
“Dear Mr. Patel,

I hope you are well. My name is Alex Kim, and I am writing to apply for the Sales Associate position at XYZ Corp (Ref #45678). I have 3 years of retail experience and a strong record of exceeding sales targets. Attached are my resume and cover letter.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background can contribute to XYZ Corp.

Sincerely,
Alex Kim
(555) 123-4567”

This email is short, specifies the role, highlights a key achievement (exceeding targets), and ends with a polite closing. Notice it also names the attachments.

## 7. Ethics note

Always follow instructions from the job posting. If it says “apply through our portal only,” don’t email anyway. Do not use AI to harvest emails or spam random recruiters. In your email, be honest about your qualifications. For example, if AI suggests an overly strong claim like “I doubled sales singlehandedly,” only use it if it’s true. If you got help on a project, mention your collaborators appropriately. If you’re emailing about a role you’re underqualified for, don’t pretend – instead, emphasize eagerness to learn. Finally, make sure any AI suggestions maintain respectful, inclusive language. For example, avoid any assumption about the reader (e.g., “Hi guys”) and use full names and proper titles.

## 8. Common mistakes & how to fix

- **No clear subject:** Subject lines like “Hello” or “Job Inquiry” are too vague. **Fix:** Always include your name and the position. If AI gave you something weak, refine it with one of the prompts above.
- **Forgot attachment:** You wrote “resume attached” but forgot to attach it. **Fix:** Double-check attachments before sending! AI can remind you, but also manually verify.
- **Too long or rambling:** Writing a novel in the email. **Fix:** Aim for 3-4 short paragraphs max. AI often keeps things concise if you prompt well. If you see long blocks, ask the AI to make it shorter.
- **Generic content:** Sending the same email to everyone without change. **Fix:** Customize even a little – mention the company name, or a detail like “I enjoyed meeting you at the job fair.” AI can help personalize if you feed it the detail.
- **Typos or informal language:** Even one typo hurts professionalism. **Fix:** Use AI grammar checking or tools like Grammarly to catch errors. The Indeed guide explicitly suggests proofreading for accuracy.

If the AI output seems off (e.g. too informal or missing details), tweak it. The final responsibility for correctness is yours.

## 9. Quality checklist

-   **Subject line clear and specific**, including name and job title.
-   **Greeting uses the recipient’s name** (no generic “To whom it may concern” unless absolutely necessary).
-   **First sentence states purpose** of email (applying, following up, etc.).
-   **Highlights your fit:** briefly mention one relevant qualification or interest.
-   **Attachments mentioned and attached:** e.g. resume, cover letter.
-   **Professional tone:** no slang, correct punctuation, no ALL CAPS.
-    **Contact info in signature:** full name, phone, LinkedIn URL (optional).
-    **Length is appropriate:** ideally 150–250 words, easy to read.
-    **Names spelled correctly:** double-check company and person names.

Run through this list before hitting send to catch any oversight.

## 11. Disclaimer

Writing better emails can help you stand out, but it doesn’t guarantee a response or job. Every recruiter and company is different. AI-generated language is a draft tool only; always check that it aligns with your actual qualifications and the role’s requirements. If a company specifies how to apply (e.g. through an online form), follow that instead of emailing. Use your judgment when interacting.
