## 1. What you’ll accomplish

In this guide, you’ll prepare effectively for a **recruiter phone screen** – the quick call that often kicks off the interview process. You’ll learn how to research the company, craft a brief introduction of yourself, and anticipate common recruiter questions. AI will help you simulate a phone interview, refine your “elevator pitch,” and remember key points about the company. By the end, you’ll be ready to answer confidently and make a great first impression on a recruiter or hiring manager’s call.

## 2. Who this is for / when to use it

Any job seeker expecting an initial call (phone or video) from HR or a recruiter will benefit. Typically, companies do a short screening to confirm your fit before a full interview. This workflow is for candidates who want to ensure they cover all bases: introducing themselves well, answering recruiter questions, and gathering info. Use this right before your scheduled screen – after you’ve already applied and hopefully secured the call.

## 3. Inputs you need

- **Job description:** Key skills and qualifications the recruiter will be checking.
- **Company research:** Company website, recent news, or values. We’ll gather talking points from these.
- **Your pitch:** A short summary of who you are (see step 4).
- **Your resume:** To reference during the call if needed.
- **AI assistant:** To practice questions and responses.

## 4. Step-by-step workflow

1. **Confirm logistics.** Make sure you know the exact call time and format (phone or video). Add it to your calendar with a reminder. If something comes up, proactively reschedule – clarity is key. Recruiters appreciate honesty: if you need more time to prepare, let them know as soon as possible.
2. **Gather background info.** Research the company: visit their website, LinkedIn, or news articles. Note their mission, products, or recent news. AI can help summarize this: *“What are the latest news about [Company]?”* or *“Tell me about [Company] and its products.”* This helps you show you’ve done your homework. Indeed advises knowing company values and culture before the call.
3. **Review the job requirements.** Look at the description again and jot down how your skills match. Recruiters may ask, “Why are you interested?” or “Do you have experience with X?” Use AI to rehearse these: *“Given these job requirements, how should I answer why I’m a fit?”*. Make bullet points of examples you’ll mention.
4. **Prepare your intro.** Plan a 1-2 minute self-introduction: who you are, your background, and why you’re calling in (e.g., interest in the role). AI can help refine it: *“Here is my draft intro: [your text]. Improve the clarity and brevity.”* Keep it professional and focused on the job. The Medium blog suggests writing it out and letting AI “clean it up” as an editor.
5. **Practice common questions.** Recruiters often start with “Tell me about yourself” and then ask some basics (availability, salary expectations, etc.). You should have a brief answer for each. Use AI to role-play: *“Act as a recruiter and ask me common screening questions.”* Answer them, then ask the AI to critique. For example: *“I said [your answer]. How can I improve that?”* This builds your confidence.
6. **Plan follow-up questions.** At the end, recruiters usually ask if you have questions. Prepare 1-2 thoughtful ones (about the team or next steps). AI can suggest good questions: *“What questions should I ask a recruiter at the end of a phone screen?”* Common tips include asking about timeline or role fit.
7. **Tech check and notes.** If it’s a phone call, charge your phone and find a quiet spot. Keep your resume and notes in front of you for reference. If video, test your camera/mic ahead of time. Note-taking is fine – if you do so, mention it (e.g., “Let me take a note of that.”) as Indeed suggests preparing notes of things you want to mention. Having notes on your skills, achievements, and questions ensures you won’t forget key points.

## 5. Prompt templates

- **Company research summary:**
  *Prompt:* “Summarize [Company] in a few bullet points: industry, mission, and recent news.”
  *Purpose:* To quickly get talking points about the company.
  *Customization:* Replace [Company] with the actual name. Use the bullets during the interview to show interest (e.g., “I saw you recently launched…”).

- **Elevator pitch polish:**
  *Prompt:* “Here’s my 1-minute intro: [your draft]. Rewrite it to be concise and engaging.”
  *Purpose:* To tighten your self-introduction.
  *Customization:* Include your role, experience, and one selling point. AI will rephrase it for clarity.

- **Phone screen questions:**
  *Prompt:* “List the top 5 questions a recruiter would ask on a phone screen for a [Job Title] position.”
  *Purpose:* To know what to expect and prepare answers.
  *Customization:* Use your target role. AI will likely give questions about fit, availability, salary expectations, etc.

- **Answer refinement:**
  *Prompt:* “I answered this phone screen question: [your answer]. Improve it to be more concise and professional.”
  *Purpose:* To clean up your phrasing before the actual call.
  *Customization:* Copy your tentative spoken answer (even bullet form) and let AI tighten it up.

*(Use these prompts in a chat session before the call to simulate the interaction and refine your responses.)*

## 6. Example output

**Question:** “Tell me a bit about your background.”
**Your draft answer:** “I’m a recent graduate who studied marketing. I interned at a startup where I did social media marketing and helped increase followers. I’m very excited about this role.”
**AI-polished:** “I have a degree in marketing and recently interned at a tech startup, where I managed social media campaigns that grew our audience by 25%. I’m excited about the opportunity to bring that experience to this [Target Role] position.”

The improved answer is concise, mentions a measurable result, and ties to your goal.

## 7. Ethics note

Be honest about your background and intentions. Don’t mislead the recruiter. For instance, if you ask AI for salary advice, remember it’s only a suggestion. Always verify with real salary data or personal requirements. If an AI prompt suggests certain accomplishments, make sure they are true. Recruiters expect integrity, and AI’s role here is to help communicate, not to invent your story.

Also, respect the recruiter’s time. If AI suggests ways to make your answers longer, balance that – keep them concise on the call. If the recruiter says “We’re a global company,” don’t say “I want to see the world,” unless it’s sincerely a goal. Use AI feedback critically.

## 8. Common mistakes & how to fix

- **Talking too much or too little:** Rambling can lose the recruiter’s interest; one-liners can seem unprepared. **Fix:** Practice timing your intro and answers. Use AI to trim or expand answers as needed.
- **Not researching the company:** Giving no indication you know what they do. **Fix:** Reference one fact from your research (AI or otherwise) to show engagement (“I noticed you specialize in healthcare tech”). This shows you did prep.
- **Not having questions:** Ending abruptly. **Fix:** Always have at least one or two questions. If you forget, you can say “I’d like to ask about…” during the call.
- **Being unprepared for small talk:** Sometimes recruiters start with light banter. **Fix:** Think of one neutral topic in advance (e.g. “How are you today?” with a prepared positive answer). Keep it professional.

If you realize during practice that you’re struggling (for instance, the AI says your pitch is too long), adjust accordingly and try again. The goal is smooth confidence.

## 9. Quality checklist

-   Did I schedule the call and set a reminder?
-   Did I research the company’s mission and recent news?
-   Do I have a 30-second elevator pitch ready?
-   Am I familiar with my own resume so I can speak about it?
-   Did I practice answering the recruiter’s likely questions (my experience, salary range, availability)?
-   Do I have 1–2 questions prepared to ask them at the end?
-   Is my phone charged and notes/resume accessible?
-   Am I in a quiet space, wearing appropriate attire (if video)?

Go down this list to ensure no detail is overlooked. Even a small point like “phone on do-not-disturb” can save you from a dropped call.

## 11. Disclaimer

This guide offers preparation tips. Each recruiter and call is different. We cannot promise any outcome (you might still not be selected, for reasons beyond this advice). AI can help structure answers, but make sure to adapt any suggestions to your real situation. Some recruiters explicitly say “do not record this call” or “don’t have notes visible,” so use your notes judiciously. Stay honest and professional on the call.
