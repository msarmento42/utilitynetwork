## 1. What you’ll accomplish

In this workflow, you’ll put together or improve your professional portfolio using AI. We guide you through selecting your best work, organizing it, and writing strong project descriptions. AI will help you emphasize the skills and results from each project. The end result is a portfolio (digital or PDF) that clearly demonstrates your expertise to employers, in a way that aligns with your job goals.

## 2. Who this is for / when to use it

This is for job seekers in fields that often require portfolios: designers, developers, writers, marketers, engineers, and anyone whose work is demonstrated by examples. Even in other fields, a portfolio (or project list) can be useful. If you have substantial projects or case studies, use this to frame them effectively. Do this before interviews (so you can share it) or when applying to jobs that specifically request work samples.

## 3. Inputs you need

- **List of key projects:** Titles or brief descriptions of your top 3–5 projects. Include the project name, your role, and a short note on outcome (e.g. “Website redesign – Led dev team, increased traffic 40%”).
- **Details of each project:** Technologies used, your specific contributions, challenges overcome, and results/metrics.
- **Target role keywords:** Skills or achievements the job wants to see (so you can highlight relevant parts of your projects).
- **AI assistant:** To help write descriptions and highlight strengths.

## 4. Step-by-step workflow

1. **Select your showcase projects.** Choose work that best demonstrates skills needed for your target jobs. It could be a website you built, a marketing campaign, a research paper, etc. Aim for 3-5 strong examples. Indeed notes that portfolios are especially important in fields like design and tech, so pick projects that clearly show your abilities and results.
2. **Gather project facts.** For each project, list the context and your role. What problem was being solved? What tools/skills you used (e.g. “React, Photoshop, Python”)? What was your contribution (coding, designing, managing)? What was the outcome (percentage improvement, user feedback, sales increase)? AI needs these facts to craft a narrative.
3. **Write project descriptions.** Use AI prompts to turn your bullet points into polished text. For example: *“Summarize my project: I built a mobile app for language learning that 10,000 users downloaded. I did front-end in Flutter and user research.”* AI might write: “Developed a Flutter-based mobile app for language learning. Led front-end development and conducted user research, resulting in 10,000 downloads in the first month.” Repeat for each project. This makes descriptions concise and accomplishment-focused.
4. **Highlight skills and outcomes.** Ensure each description clearly mentions a skill or value (e.g., “web development”, “event management”). Include numbers or impacts whenever possible (e.g. “increased engagement by 50%”). AI can help quantify: if you say “successful campaign,” you could ask it: *“Give me an example percentage improvement to put in this sentence.”* Only use figures you remember or estimate carefully.
5. **Organize your portfolio.** Put these descriptions with visuals or links if available (like screenshots or URLs). If it’s a PDF portfolio, ensure it's well-designed but simple (AI can’t help design, stick to clean templates). Create sections or pages for each project. If digital (a personal website), use these descriptions as captions or project pages.
6. **Review for consistency.** Make sure your tone and format match across projects. AI can re-phrase to uniform style if needed. Verify all technical terms are correct, and that you have credited any collaborators or references (e.g. “led team of 3 designers” if applicable). The Indeed guide emphasizes including varied materials (resume, samples, skills) in a logical way, so consider adding a brief intro or conclusion explaining your overall expertise.

## 5. Prompt templates

- **Project description:**
  *Prompt:* “Write a concise description of my project for a portfolio: [paste your bullet points]. Highlight the main goal and result.”
  *Purpose:* To craft a clear narrative about the project.
  *Customization:* Provide context (e.g. “This was an academic project on algorithm optimization”). The AI will output a short paragraph or bullet.

- **Skills extraction:**
  *Prompt:* “List the key skills demonstrated by this project description: [paste your draft description].”
  *Purpose:* To ensure you’ve identified what skills each project showcases.
  *Customization:* After your AI outputs a description, use this prompt to see if any skill (like teamwork, coding languages, design) should be made more explicit.

- **Outcome emphasis:**
  *Prompt:* “Emphasize the results in this statement: [your project statement without metrics].”
  *Purpose:* To add measurable outcomes.
  *Customization:* If you have data (e.g. “improved performance”), ask AI to articulate it (e.g., “Improved performance, increasing efficiency by ___%.”). Insert realistic numbers that reflect your work.

- **Portfolio introduction:**
  *Prompt:* “Write a brief intro for my portfolio: [list your roles or a one-liner about your career]. Include what connects these projects.”
  *Purpose:* If you want a one-paragraph overview at the top of your portfolio.
  *Customization:* Provide your current title and a theme (e.g. “Software engineer with interest in healthcare technology”).

*(Use AI to generate draft text for each part, but always verify the content yourself. The AI is helping with phrasing and structure.)*

## 6. Example output

**Project:** “E-commerce website redesign – I led a team of 4 to rebuild an online store.”

**AI Portfolio entry:**
*"E-commerce Platform Redesign – Led a cross-functional team of 4 developers to overhaul an online store. Implemented a responsive design and improved checkout flow, resulting in a 30% increase in sales conversion rate. Technologies used: React, Node.js."*

This description clearly states your role, what you did (redesign, tech used), and quantifies the outcome (30% increase).

## 7. Ethics note

Your portfolio should **reflect your real work**. Only include projects you contributed to. If AI suggests phrasing like “single-handedly did X,” make sure it’s true. If it doesn’t fit, adjust it: you might have helped or collaborated. Give credit where it’s due (mention team size or collaborators if applicable). Do not copy content from others’ portfolios or from proprietary sources; use your own words or AI-generated text based on your knowledge. Avoid confidential info (e.g., internal company data) unless publicly available. Always have permission to show any content that isn’t originally yours.

Also maintain professional tone. AI might come up with jargon; if it sounds offensive or braggy, rephrase. Our focus is on competence and results, not personal opinions.

## 8. Common mistakes & how to fix

- **Overloading text:** Descriptions that are long paragraphs. **Fix:** Aim for one or two sentences per project. AI should help condense ideas.
- **No metrics:** Simply saying “improved something” without numbers. **Fix:** Either recall data or ask AI to suggest a concrete example (like “increased traffic by X%”). If actual numbers are confidential, use approximate or relative terms carefully.
- **Unclear role:** Say “project was great” without specifying what you did. **Fix:** Make sure each description starts with your role (e.g., “I developed…”, “Led a team…”, “Designed…”). AI usually includes an “I” statement if prompted correctly.
- **Ignoring relevance:** Including projects unrelated to your target field. **Fix:** Focus on projects that use similar skills as the job. If you need to include a less relevant project, tailor its description to highlight transferable skills (e.g., a volunteer project can show project management).

If AI produces a polished description but you realize you didn’t actually achieve what it says, correct it. For example, if AI says “increased sales” but your project was not about sales, change it to something you did achieve.

## 9. Quality checklist

-   Did I choose projects that **align with my career goals** (e.g. coding projects for a developer role)?
-   Does each project description mention at least one key skill or technology?
-   Are there **tangible results** or achievements listed (numbers, recognition)?
-   Is the language clear and concise (no run-on sentences)?
-   Is my role clearly stated (e.g., “led,” “developed,” “designed”)?
-   Did I spell-check and proofread each description?
-   Are the project visuals or links working and easy to view?
-   Does the portfolio look organized and professional?

Use this list to ensure your portfolio is polished. A recruiter should quickly see your strengths.
