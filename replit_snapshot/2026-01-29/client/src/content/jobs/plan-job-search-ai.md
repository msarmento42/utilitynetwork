## 1. What you’ll accomplish

With this workflow, you’ll leverage AI to **plan your job search strategically**. You’ll identify target roles, discover the skills you have (and need), and make a timeline or schedule for applying. AI can suggest career paths and even recommend specific job titles based on your background. By the end, you’ll have a clear action plan: which roles to apply for, which skills to highlight or learn, and a structured schedule that keeps you moving forward.

## 2. Who this is for / when to use it

Use this guide at the very start of your job hunt or when you want to make a big change (like switching fields). It’s helpful if you’re overwhelmed by job options or not sure what positions to pursue. This is for proactive planning: before you start sending applications en masse, define your goals and strategy. It benefits students planning their first job search, professionals exploring a new career path, and anyone wanting an organized approach.

## 3. Inputs you need

- **Your current resume or CV:** To provide AI with your background, including education and work experience.
- **Personal interests and strengths:** List a few industries or roles you are interested in, and skills you enjoy using.
- **Geographic/location preferences (if any):** The area where you want to work.
- **Timeline:** How soon you’d like to land a job, or weekly hours you can dedicate to the search.
- **AI assistant:** For generating insights and schedules.

## 4. Step-by-step workflow

1. **Identify transferable skills.** Start by asking AI: *“Based on my resume [paste your summary or key points], what are my top skills and strengths?”* The AI will parse your experience and list skills (like “project management,” “Java programming,” etc.). This helps you articulate your value. Google’s AI-driven course notes that AI can help “uncover transferable skills”, so use it to see all angles.
2. **Explore related roles.** With those skills and interests, ask AI for job suggestions: *“What are some job titles I could apply for with experience in [skill1, skill2] and interest in [industry]?”* AI might suggest roles you hadn’t considered. Make a list of roles (5-10) that seem like a good fit.
3. **Match skills to jobs.** For each role, find a sample job description (you can use AI or actual postings). Identify any skill gaps: *“I have these skills: [list]. The [Job X] requires [list]. How can I address or learn the missing skills?”* AI might suggest online courses or ways to gain experience. Note any certifications or training you might pursue.
4. **Set goals and timeline.** Decide on a realistic timeline. For instance, aim to apply to X jobs per week. Use AI to help allocate tasks: *“Create a weekly schedule to apply to 10 jobs and network for 2 hours each day.”* This creates a disciplined plan. Google’s job search course emphasizes turning search into a plan.
5. **Research companies.** Once you have target roles, make a list of companies you admire. AI can help find these: *“List top companies hiring for [Role] in [Location/Industry]."* Then, schedule time to research each one or tailor an application.
6. **Use AI for ongoing optimization.** Periodically (weekly or biweekly), ask AI to review your plan: *“I applied to these jobs and had these results [list]. Suggest improvements for my plan.”* It may note if you need to expand your search or focus on higher-leverage opportunities. 92% of people in one AI-driven job search program felt better prepared after using AI, so use AI as a check-in tool as you proceed.

## 5. Prompt templates

- **Skill assessment:**
  *Prompt:* “Review my experience: [paste your resume summary]. List my key skills and how they can apply to other industries.”
  *Purpose:* To map what you have to new opportunities.
  *Customization:* Give enough context (current role, field) so AI knows where you’re coming from.

- **Role exploration:**
  *Prompt:* “What are 5 emerging job roles that combine [skill] and [interest]? Provide a short description for each.”
  *Purpose:* To discover new or niche roles you might not know.
  *Customization:* Input your skills (e.g., “Python, data analysis”) and interests (e.g., “healthcare”).

- **Search plan scheduler:**
  *Prompt:* “Help me create a 4-week job search plan. I can dedicate 10 hours per week and want to apply to 10 jobs weekly, network 5 hours per week, and learn a new skill.”
  *Purpose:* To structure your time.
  *Customization:* Adjust hours and targets as you prefer. AI will suggest a day-by-day or week-by-week breakdown.

- **Progress check:**
  *Prompt:* “Given this summary of my job search [list applications, interviews, etc.], what should I focus on next?”
  *Purpose:* To get guidance on any stalls or next steps.
  *Customization:* Regularly update it with your actual status to get tailored advice.

*(Use these prompts as brainstorming and planning aids. The final plan should still be tailored by you.)*

## 6. Example output

**Identified role:** AI suggests “Data Analyst” for your background.
**Plan snippet:**
- Week 1: Identify 10 data analyst openings, tailor resume for 5, reach out to 3 network contacts.
- Week 2: Apply to 5 more, complete one short online course on SQL, prepare for any upcoming interviews.

**Skills to develop:** Maybe AI noted “SQL and Tableau” if they were missing from your resume, and recommended a one-month course on each.

These actionable steps help you move systematically.

## 7. Ethics note

AI can give you career ideas, but verify them. Don’t rely solely on AI’s job suggestions – cross-check with real job boards to see if those roles exist and interest you. Also, AI might mention jobs or skills biased by its training; be critical of any suggestion that feels off. Always ensure your plan respects your personal circumstances (like location, visa status, or workload). And if AI points you to acquire a new skill, consider the time it takes; don’t overcommit.

Ensure any strategy AI suggests aligns with your values. For instance, if AI says “apply to 50 jobs blindly,” you may choose quality over quantity instead. Use AI’s output as input, but you make the final decision.

## 8. Common mistakes & how to fix

- **Too broad a search:** Applying to unrelated jobs just for the sake of it. **Fix:** Let AI help narrow roles to those fitting your profile. If it suggests anything unclear, research it before adding to your list.
- **No schedule:** Saying “I’ll do applications later.” **Fix:** Actually put time slots on your calendar (AI can help draft that schedule). Treat your job search like a project with deadlines.
- **Ignoring feedback:** If you get rejections or no responses, not adjusting strategy. **Fix:** Use AI to analyze outcomes. For example, *“I applied to 20 jobs, got 0 interviews. My resume says [key skills]. Why might I not be getting responses?”* Maybe you need to add or change something.
- **Burnout:** Overplanning without breaks. **Fix:** Include rest or reward days. AI might suggest including downtime if prompted (e.g. *“Balance job search tasks with one day off per week.”*).

If AI tells you to do something unrealistic, challenge it. For example, AI might recommend a cert that’s expensive or time-consuming; consider simpler alternatives like free tutorials.

## 9. Quality checklist

-   Have I identified at least 3 target job titles that fit my background?
-   Did I list the skills I already have and note which ones to improve?
-   Have I gathered at least 15 relevant companies to consider?
-   Is there a clear weekly plan (with specific tasks and time) for applying and networking?
-   Am I tracking progress in some way (e.g., on a calendar or tracker)?
-   Have I scheduled time for skill-building if needed (courses, practice)?
-   Did I set short-term goals (this week) and a goal for when I aim to be in a new role?

Check these off in your planning doc. If anything is missing (like a set number of applications per week), add it now.

## 11. Disclaimer

This planning advice is informational. There’s no guaranteed way to secure a job. AI-suggested roles or timelines are only suggestions – always tailor them to your real-world schedule and situation. We recommend verifying any career advice from AI with mentors or real job market research. The AI approach is a guide to make your search more organized, but persistence and adaptability are equally important.
