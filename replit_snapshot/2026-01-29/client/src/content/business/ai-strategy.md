# AI Strategy for Small Business

Small businesses are uniquely positioned to benefit from AI because of their agility. Unlike large corporations, you can implement new tools over a weekend.

## Key Areas for Implementation

1. **Customer Support**: Automated chatbots can handle 80% of queries.
2. **Content Creation**: Use LLMs to draft blog posts and social media copy.
3. **Data Analysis**: structured data analysis without a data scientist.

## The 3-Step Plan

Start small. Don't try to automate everything at once. Pick one pain point, solve it with AI, and then move to the next.

### Recommended Tools

- **ChatGPT/Claude**: For drafting and brainstorming.
- **Midjourney**: For visual assets.
- **Zapier**: For connecting everything together.
