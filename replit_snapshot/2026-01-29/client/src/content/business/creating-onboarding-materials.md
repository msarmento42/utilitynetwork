## What you'll accomplish

In this workflow, you will learn how to use AI to generate materials that help onboard a new team member or client. By the end, you'll have draft outlines or documents for things like welcome guides, training agendas, or orientation checklists. The AI will help you structure the content and suggest items to include (like key company info, training steps, or resources), saving time on initial draft creation.

## Who this is for

This guide is for small business owners, managers, HR personnel, or consultants who need to create training or onboarding content quickly. If you frequently bring on new employees, freelancers, or clients, you know it can be time-consuming to prepare all the materials (slides, guides, checklists). This workflow assumes you have a general understanding of what the new person needs to learn; the AI will fill in the details. No specialized design skills are needed, just clarity on who is being onboarded (role or client).

## Inputs

Collect the following information:
- **Role or onboarding context:** Specify who is being onboarded (e.g., "New sales representative", "New customer after purchase"). This sets the context and tone.
- **Key information or topics:** List the important areas to cover (for example, company background, product overview, software tutorials, compliance training).
- **Resources and references:** Any existing materials or references you want included (like links to company handbook, brand guidelines, or process docs).
- **Timeline or schedule:** Rough idea of how long the onboarding should take (e.g., first week, first month). This helps structure the sequence.

## Step-by-step workflow

1. **Outline the onboarding plan.** Ask the AI to create a schedule or checklist.
   ```
   Create a 1-week onboarding schedule for a new [Role]. Include daily focus areas and key tasks.
   ```
2. **Draft welcome content.** Generate a welcome email or document introduction.
   ```
   Write a warm welcome email for a new employee starting as a [Role] on [Date]. Include a brief overview of their first day.
   ```
3. **Create training modules/guides.** For specific topics, ask the AI to draft content.
   ```
   Write a short training guide on [Topic] for a beginner. Explain the key concepts and steps.
   ```
4. **Compile resources.** Ask the AI to list necessary tools or access rights.
   ```
   List the software and accounts a new [Role] typically needs access to.
   ```
5. **Review and customize.** Assemble the pieces into a cohesive package. Add specific company details (Wi-Fi passwords, contact names) that the AI wouldn't know.

## Prompt templates

- **Onboarding checklist:**
  ```
  "Create a comprehensive onboarding checklist for a new [Role]. Divide it into 'Before Day 1', 'Day 1', and 'First Week'."
  ```
- **Training content:**
  ```
  "Explain [Process/Tool] to a new employee in simple terms. Use bullet points."
  ```
- **Welcome packet intro:**
  ```
  "Write an introduction for our Employee Handbook that reflects our company culture: [Culture description]."
  ```

## Example output

- **Schedule snippet:**
  ```
  Day 1: Orientation & Setup
  - 9:00 AM: Welcome meeting with manager
  - 10:00 AM: IT setup (email, Slack, CRM)
  - 12:00 PM: Team lunch
  - 2:00 PM: Company overview presentation
  ```
- **Checklist item:**
  ```
  [ ] Sign NDA and contract
  [ ] Set up direct deposit
  [ ] Review safety policy
  ```

## Common mistakes

- **Too many details at once:** Asking the AI for too many specific tasks in one prompt can produce an overwhelming list. Break it down section by section.
- **Missing stakeholders:** If you omit who should be involved (like mentors or IT support), the plan may miss key steps. Always specify roles if needed.
- **Generic tone:** The AI might use bland language. Make sure to review and tweak the tone so it feels welcoming and on-brand.
- **Overlooking follow-up:** Ensure the plan includes follow-ups or feedback sessions. AI might not add these unless prompted.

## Quality checklist

- The onboarding outline has a logical sequence (orientation, training, integration).
- Each section (company info, tools, first tasks) is covered with relevant details.
- Tone is welcoming and clear (no confusing jargon).
- Checklist items are actionable and specific (e.g., "set up email account" rather than just "computer").
- The final draft is formatted with headings, bullets, and any placeholders replaced (like [Company Name]).
