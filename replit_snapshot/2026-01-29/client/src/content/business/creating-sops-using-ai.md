## What you'll accomplish

In this workflow, you’ll learn how to use AI to create clear and organized Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) documents for your business. SOPs are detailed, step-by-step instructions that explain how to perform routine tasks consistently. By the end of this guide, you will have an outline or draft of an SOP that can be refined into a final document. The AI will help you list all the necessary steps and details for a process, saving you time and ensuring nothing is overlooked.


## Who this is for

This workflow is for small business owners, managers, or team leaders who need to document recurring processes (such as onboarding new customers, processing orders, or handling customer inquiries) but find it time-consuming. It is also useful for solopreneurs who want to make their processes more reliable. You should have a basic understanding of the process you want to document; the AI can help flesh it out. No specific technical expertise is required, just a clear goal of the process to automate or document.

## Inputs

Prepare the following inputs for the AI:
- **Process name and purpose:** A brief description of the process (for example, "Customer Onboarding Procedure" and its goal, like introducing new customers to our service).
- **Process owner or roles involved:** Who is responsible for the process and who needs to carry it out (e.g., Sales team, HR, customer support).
- **Key steps (draft):** Any initial ideas or high-level steps you already know (e.g., "1. Send welcome email, 2. Schedule training session, 3. Collect feedback").
- **Resources and references:** Any relevant templates, forms, or documents that relate to the process (for example, a contract template for onboarding or an existing checklist).
- **Desired format and style:** How detailed it should be (summary vs. full instructions) and any formatting preferences (like bullet points, numbered list, or narrative style).


Having these details will guide the AI in producing a structured SOP outline that matches your needs.

## Step-by-step workflow

1. **Describe the process clearly.** Write a short overview of the process and its goal. Provide this context to the AI. Example prompt:
   ```
   I want to create an SOP for [Process Name]. The purpose of this process is [purpose]. The responsible team/role is [team/role]. Outline the major steps involved.
   ```
   The AI will list the major steps in order, like a table of contents.
2. **Review and refine the main steps.** Look at the AI’s suggested steps. Edit or re-order them as needed to match the actual workflow. If any step is missing or extraneous, adjust it. This ensures the outline fits your real-world process.
3. **Expand each step with details.** For each major step, ask the AI to write sub-steps or instructions. For example:
   ```
   Step 2 is "Send welcome email." Write a detailed list of sub-steps or actions for this step.
   ```
   The AI can generate bullets or numbered actions (e.g., who sends the email, what to include, when to send, etc.).
4. **Add relevant notes or guidelines.** After expanding steps, consider if there are important notes, warnings, or tips to include. Ask the AI to add these. For example:
   ```
   For the step "Collect feedback," include notes about what feedback form to use and how long to wait.
   ```
   The AI can insert helpful details (like "use the standard feedback survey sent 7 days after training").
5. **Compile the SOP draft.** Combine the steps and sub-steps into a single document. Format it in a clean way: use headings, bullet points, or tables as needed. You might prompt the AI to generate a formatted draft:
   ```
   Using the steps and details we've outlined, produce a clean draft SOP document for [Process Name]. Include sections and bullets.
   ```
   Then review and make any necessary edits (for clarity, completeness, or to match your style).

This process turns your initial ideas into a structured SOP outline, which you can finalize into a full procedure document.

## Prompt templates


Use these prompt examples to guide the AI when creating SOPs:

- **SOP outline request:**
  ```
  "I need an SOP outline for [Process Name] in [context/company]. The process involves [brief description]. List the main steps involved in order."
  ```
- **Detail a step:**
  ```
  "For the step '[Step Name]', list the sub-steps and details needed to complete it. Include who does it and any notes."
  ```
- **Add notes or guidelines:**
  ```
  "Add any important tips, notes, or warnings for the step '[Step Name]' in the process."
  ```
- **Generate final draft:**
  ```
  "Combine these steps and details into a formatted Standard Operating Procedure draft. Use clear headings and bullet points."
  ```

Modify the bracketed parts and details to match your exact process.

## Example output

An example AI output might include:
- **Main steps list:**
  ```
  1. Initiate process (e.g. send introduction email)
  2. Gather information (e.g. customer details, paperwork)
  3. Setup and delivery (e.g. activate account, deliver product)
  4. Follow-up (e.g. send confirmation and feedback request)
  ```
- **Expanded step detail:** For "Initiate process":
  ```
  - The sales rep sends a welcome email within 24 hours of signup.
  - The email includes login details and contact information.
  - Schedule a kickoff call by sending a calendar invitation.
  ```
- **Notes:** For "Follow-up":
  ```
  *Note:* Wait one week after delivery to send a feedback survey using the standard form.
  ```
- **Draft SOP snippet:**
  ```
  # Customer Onboarding SOP
  **Objective:** Provide new customers with all needed information for a successful first month.

  ## Steps:
  1. **Send Welcome Email**
     - [ ] Sales rep sends welcome email within 24 hours (template: Welcome_Email.docx).
     - [ ] Include invoice and login info.
     - [ ] Schedule kickoff call (invite templates available).
     *Note:* Use the updated email template from March 2025.
  2. **Gather Customer Info**
     - [ ] Fill out the onboarding checklist form.
     - [ ] Collect signed contract and ID copies.
     ...
  ```
  This draft would then be reviewed and adjusted as needed.

## Common mistakes


- **Incomplete inputs:** If you provide too little context (e.g. just "Create SOP for X" with no details), the AI might miss important steps. Make sure to include the process context and purpose.
- **Overlooking steps:** Relying entirely on AI-generated steps without human review can omit critical steps that AI might not guess. Always verify with someone who knows the process.
- **Too much detail at once:** Trying to get the AI to write a full SOP in one go can be overwhelming. It's better to break it down (outline first, then detail each part).
- **Ignoring company-specific requirements:** AI provides general advice. Make sure your final SOP follows any internal guidelines, compliance rules, or legal requirements specific to your business.

## Quality checklist

- The SOP outline flows logically and covers all major phases of the process.
- Each step includes clear instructions or sub-steps.
- Assigned roles or responsible persons are specified for each step.
- Any relevant resources or templates are referenced (or attached separately).
- The language is clear and easy to follow (use consistent tense and voice).
- Check for missing steps by comparing against current practice or checklists.
