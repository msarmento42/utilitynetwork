## What you'll accomplish

In this workflow, you will use AI to collect and summarize information about your market. By following these steps, you'll produce a report containing competitor analysis, customer profiles, and market trends. The AI can help you gather data from public sources, identify key competitors and market segments, and synthesize insights so you can make informed decisions without manually scouring every source.

## Who this is for

This guide is designed for small business owners, entrepreneurs, marketers, or product managers who need market insights but may have limited time. If you want to understand your competitors, industry trends, or customer preferences more quickly, AI can accelerate your research. You should know the basic focus of your market or industry. The AI will not replace professional research but can highlight important information for further investigation. No specialized market research training is required.

## Inputs


Prepare the following inputs:
- **Research goal:** A clear statement of what you want to learn (e.g. "Identify top 5 competitors for our product and their unique selling points").
- **Market or industry context:** Describe your market, product category, or target audience in a few sentences.
- **Product/service overview:** A brief description of your product or service, including key features or value proposition.
- **Specific questions or areas:** Any particular questions (e.g. pricing, audience demographics, trends) you want answered.
- **Scope and regions:** The geographic or niche scope of your research if relevant (e.g. "US market", "enterprise software industry").

Providing these details helps the AI focus on the most relevant information during the research process.

## Step-by-step workflow

1. **Collect competitor information.** Ask the AI to list known competitors and their offerings. Example prompt:
   ```
   "List the top 5 competitors to [Your Product/Service] and briefly describe what each offers."
   ```
   The AI will generate competitor names and quick descriptions. You should verify these and refine the list as needed.
2. **Gather customer insights.** Prompt the AI to summarize customer preferences or needs. For example:
   ```
   "Based on our product [brief description], what are common customer problems it solves, and what language do customers use to describe these needs?"
   ```
   The AI can produce a summary of pain points, use cases, or typical customer quotes. Use this to understand how to position your product.
3. **Identify market trends.** Use AI to find recent trends or news. For instance:
   ```
   "What are the current trends in [industry or market]? Summarize any emerging opportunities or threats."
   ```
   The AI should list trends like growth areas, regulatory changes, or tech advancements. Double-check current sources if accuracy is critical.
4. **Analyze strengths and weaknesses.** Ask the AI to compare your product to competitors. Example prompt:
   ```
   "Compare our product [brief description] with [Competitor A] and [Competitor B]. Highlight our strengths and their strengths."
   ```
   This yields a comparative table or bullet list of pros and cons. It helps you spot market positioning opportunities.
5. **Compile the research summary.** Combine the findings into a draft report. Prompt:
   ```
   "Using the information above, write a concise market research report highlighting competitors, customer insights, and key trends."
   ```
   Review and edit the report for completeness and accuracy before using it to guide decisions.

This approach leverages AI to quickly surface knowledge that would normally require hours of manual research.

## Prompt templates

Try these prompts to guide the market research:

- **Competitor analysis:**
  ```
  "Who are the main competitors to [company/product] in [market]? Summarize their products and differentiators."
  ```
- **Customer profiles:**

  "Describe the ideal customer for a product that [your product description]. What are their characteristics and pain points?"

  ```
- **SWOT-style comparison:**
  ```
  "Compare our product [description] with [Competitor X]. List our strengths and areas for improvement relative to them."
  ```

Adjust the content in brackets to fit your business.
