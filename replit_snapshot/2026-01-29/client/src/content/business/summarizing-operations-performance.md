## What you'll accomplish

In this workflow, you'll use AI to convert raw operational or sales data into readable summaries and insights. By the end, you'll have a clear overview of key metrics, trends, and performance highlights. The AI will help identify what's working, what needs attention, and what the data means for your business—without requiring you to manually sift through spreadsheets.

## Who this is for

This guide is for small business owners, managers, or team leads who need to understand operational performance but don't have dedicated data analysts. If you collect sales, operations, or performance data but struggle to extract meaning from it, this workflow helps. You should have the raw data available (in a spreadsheet, report, or list form). No advanced analytics or statistics background is required, just a willingness to review AI summaries critically.

## Inputs

Prepare the following:
- **Raw data or data summary:** Your sales figures, operations metrics, or performance data. This could be a list of numbers, a table, or bullet points of key figures.
- **Time period:** What period does the data cover (e.g., "Q1 2025", "January 2025").
- **Context and benchmarks:** Any previous periods' data or company goals to compare against (e.g., "January 2024 sales were $45k").
- **Focus areas:** What metrics matter most to you (e.g., revenue, customer growth, profit margin).

## Step-by-step workflow

1. **Clean and format data.** Ensure your data is clean (no sensitive info) and formatted simply (e.g., CSV text or a clear list).
2. **Ask AI to summarize.** Provide the data to the AI and ask for a summary. Example prompt:
   ```
   Here is the sales data for Q1 2025: [paste data]. Summarize the key performance trends and compare them to Q4 2024 (if provided).
   ```
3. **Request specific insights.** Ask the AI to look for specific patterns.
   ```
   What were the top 3 best-selling products? Which region had the lowest performance?
   ```
4. **Draft a report.** Ask the AI to turn the insights into a formal report or executive summary.
   ```
   Write a brief executive summary of this data for a stakeholder meeting.
   ```
5. **Review and verify.** Always double-check the AI's numbers against your original data to ensure accuracy.

## Prompt templates

- **General summary:**
  ```
  "Summarize the following operational data for [Period]. Highlight the main achievements and any areas of concern: [Data]"
  ```
- **Trend analysis:**
  ```
  "Analyze the trends in this data over the last 3 months. Is performance increasing, decreasing, or stable?"
  ```
- **Comparison:**
  ```
  "Compare the performance of Team A vs Team B based on these metrics: [Data]."
  ```

## Example output

- **Summary paragraph:**
  ```
  "In Q1 2025, overall revenue increased by 15% compared to the previous quarter. The growth was driven primarily by strong sales in the Northeast region. However, customer retention rates dropped slightly in March, indicating a potential issue with post-sale support."
  ```
- **Bulleted insights:**
  ```
  - Revenue: $150k (+15% QoQ)
  - Top Product: Widget A (500 units sold)
  - Customer Satisfaction: 4.2/5 (stable)
  - Key Issue: High return rate on Widget B (12%)
  ```

## Common mistakes

- **Pasting sensitive data:** Never put PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or confidential financial secrets into public AI tools. Anonymize data first.
- **Assuming AI math is perfect:** AI language models can make calculation errors. Verify sums and percentages manually.
- **Vague data format:** If data is unorganized, the AI may misinterpret it. Use clear headers and structures.

## Quality checklist

- The summary accurately reflects the provided data.
- Key metrics (revenue, growth, etc.) are highlighted.
- The tone is objective and professional.
- No sensitive data was exposed in the process.
