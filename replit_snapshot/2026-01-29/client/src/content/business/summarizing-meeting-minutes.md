## What you'll accomplish

In this workflow, you’ll learn how to use AI to generate clear summaries and action items from meeting notes or recordings. By the end, you'll have a concise write-up of key points and decisions from a meeting, making it easy to review outcomes and follow up on tasks. The AI will help you identify important highlights and next steps so you don't miss any critical information.

## Who this is for

This guide is for team leaders, managers, consultants, or anyone who needs to document meetings efficiently. If your meetings often run long and you need an easy way to record outcomes, this workflow can save time. It works whether you have written notes, a transcript from a voice recording, or even bullet points. No advanced tech skills are needed; just provide the meeting content and guide the AI to focus on results and actions.

## Inputs

Have the following ready:
- **Meeting notes or transcript:** Text from your meeting. This could be a bulleted list of topics, a transcript from a voice recording, or detailed notes.
- **Meeting context:** Briefly describe the meeting type or purpose (e.g., "Weekly team stand-up on March 1, 2025 about product updates").
- **Attendees and roles:** Who was in the meeting and their roles (optional, but helpful for identifying speakers or accountability).
- **Focus areas:** Specify what to emphasize (e.g., decisions made, action items, deadlines).
- **Any specific format:** If you want the summary in a certain style (bullet list, paragraphs) or with particular headings.

These inputs will guide the AI to produce a relevant and useful summary.

## Step-by-step workflow

1. **Combine notes into a single text.** If you have bullet notes or a transcript, consolidate them. Remove any irrelevant chatter or obvious filler.
2. **Ask for a summary.** Frame a prompt to have the AI summarize:
   ```
   "Summarize the following meeting notes. Highlight main decisions, key points, and action items: [paste notes]."
   ```
   The AI will produce a narrative summary and/or a list of bullets.
3. **Review the summary.** Check the AI output for correctness. Ensure that decisions and tasks are clearly captured. If something important is missing or unclear, note it.
4. **Refine and format.** Use follow-up prompts to refine the output. For example:
   ```
   "List the action items separately with responsible names and deadlines."
   "Shorten the summary to 5 bullet points covering the top topics."
   ```
   You may need to break the task into parts (like first summarize, then ask for actions).
5. **Finalize the minutes.** Compile the summary, action items, and any notes into your final document. Ensure each action has an owner and due date if known. Add any needed clarifications manually.

This gives you a quick, readable record of the meeting outcomes and next steps.

## Prompt templates

Sample prompts to use:

- **General meeting summary:**
  ```
  "Using the notes below, write a concise summary of the meeting outcomes. Include any decisions and next steps.
  [Paste meeting notes here]"
  ```
- **Extract action items:**
  ```
  "List action items from the meeting notes, including who is responsible and any deadlines."
  ```
- **Short bullet summary:**
  ```
  "Summarize the key takeaways of this meeting in 5 bullet points."
  ```
- **Decision log:**
  ```
  "Identify the decisions made in this meeting and list them."
  ```

Adjust the prompts to fit your meeting’s context.

## Example output

The AI might produce:
- **Paragraph summary:**
  ```
  "In the March 1 team meeting, we decided to launch the new feature on March 15 and assigned development tasks. Marketing will prepare a press release, and the design team will finalize UI by next week. Sales projections were updated to reflect the new launch schedule. Key action items include final testing by March 10 and a team check-in scheduled for March 8."
  ```
- **Action items list:**
  ```
  - [ ] Dev Team: Complete final testing of Feature X by March 10.
  - [ ] Marketing: Draft press release for new feature by March 5.
  - [ ] Design: Finalize UI changes by March 7.
  - [ ] All: Review sales projections document by next meeting.
  ```
- **Bullet-point summary:**
  ```
  - Launch date set for March 15, 2025 for the new feature.
  - Marketing press release and promotional plan assigned.
  - UI design updates to be completed within two weeks.
  - Projected sales figures updated to incorporate new launch timeline.
  - Next meeting: March 8 for status updates and issues.
  ```

## Common mistakes

- **Overly detailed notes:** Very long transcripts can overwhelm the AI. If needed, trim to the most relevant parts or do multiple passes.
- **Missing context:** If names or acronyms are used without explanation, the AI may get confused. Add brief explanations if needed.
- **Ambiguous action items:** If the transcript doesn't explicitly say who is doing what, the AI might guess or omit it. Verify all assignments.

## Quality checklist

- The summary captures the main purpose and outcome of the meeting.
- Action items are clear, with assigned owners and deadlines.
- Decisions are accurately recorded.
- No critical information was lost in summarization.
- The tone is professional and objective.
