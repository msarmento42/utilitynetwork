## What you'll accomplish

In this workflow, you'll use AI to craft compelling descriptions for your products or services. By the end, you will have polished product descriptions that highlight features and benefits in a customer-friendly way. The AI can help by taking technical details or bullet points and turning them into fluent marketing copy, saving time and ensuring consistency in your messaging across channels.

## Who this is for

This guide is intended for e-commerce store owners, product managers, or marketers who need to create or improve product descriptions. If you have products listed on a website, marketplace, or catalog and want descriptions that sell (without writing from scratch each time), this workflow helps. You should have the core features or specifications of your product ready. The AI will help express them vividly. No copywriting degree is required, just a clear picture of what makes your product unique.

## Inputs

Gather these inputs:
- **Product details:** A list of key features, specifications, and benefits of the product or service (for example: size, color, material, unique technology).
- **Target audience and use case:** Who the product is for and how it will be used (e.g., "busy parents looking for quick meals").
- **Tone or style:** The voice you want (e.g., casual and fun, or professional and concise). Include any keywords you want the AI to use or emphasize.
- **Product name and category:** Provide the product name, model, and category so the description is accurate and searchable.
- **Optional examples:** If you have a style guide or examples of existing descriptions you like, mention them for guidance.

These inputs will help the AI highlight the right features and speak to the right audience.

## Step-by-step workflow

1. **Create a prompt with product info.** Write a prompt that includes the product details and instructions. Example:
   ```
   "Write a product description for [Product Name]: [Feature list]. The audience is [audience]. Tone should be [tone]."
   ```
   Provide all the inputs you gathered. The AI will generate a draft description.
2. **Review and refine key points.** Check the draft to ensure all important features and benefits are mentioned. If the AI missed something or added irrelevant info, note it.
3. **Ask for improvements.** Request the AI to enhance the draft. For example:
   ```
   "Make this description more engaging and customer-friendly, and highlight [specific feature]."
   ```
   You can also ask for variations or shorter/longer versions if needed.
4. **Ensure accuracy and SEO.** Verify that product details (like measurements or material) are correct. If SEO is a concern, prompt the AI to include relevant keywords or phrases. For example:
   ```
   "Include the keyword '[keyword]' naturally in the description."
   ```
5. **Finalize the description.** Once satisfied, copy the text into your product listing or marketing content. Double-check formatting (like bullet vs. paragraph) and adjust any style manually if needed.

Using AI this way speeds up writing while still letting you control the final content.

## Prompt templates

Try these example prompts:

- **Basic description:**
  ```
  "Write a clear and engaging product description for [Product Name] which [brief product details]. The tone should be [tone] and aimed at [audience]."
  ```
- **Feature-focused:**
  ```
  "Focus on these key features: [list of features]. Write a product description that shows how these benefit the customer."
  ```
- **Tone variation:**
  ```
  "Create a concise, technical description and a separate fun, casual description for the same product."
  ```
- **SEO-friendly:**
  ```
  "Revise the description to include the keyword '[keyword]' while keeping it natural and persuasive."
  ```

Replace placeholders with actual product info and audience details.

## Example output

AI-generated product descriptions might look like:
- **Draft description:**
  ```
  "Our EcoBottle is a 16oz reusable water bottle made from stainless steel. It keeps drinks cold for up to 24 hours and hot for up to 12 hours. With its sleek design and leak-proof lid, it's perfect for workouts or office use. EcoBottle is BPA-free and eco-friendly, making it a responsible choice for the environment."
  ```
- **Revised description:**
  ```
  "Meet the EcoBottle – your new go-to for hydration. This 16oz stainless steel bottle stays icy cold through the day (24 hours!) or piping hot on chilly mornings (12 hours). Its slim, stylish design fits any car cup holder, and the leak-proof cap means no spills on your commute. Plus, it's BPA-free and earth-friendly. Sip smarter with EcoBottle."
  ```
- **Bullet-point highlight:**
  ```
  - 16oz stainless steel water bottle
  - Double-wall insulation keeps drinks cold 24h / hot 12h
  - Leak-proof screw-top lid
  - BPA-free, eco-friendly design
  ```
- **SEO version:**
  ```
  "Stay hydrated in style with the EcoBottle reusable water bottle. This 16oz bottle features double-wall stainless steel insulation (keeps drinks cold up to 24h) and a leak-proof lid. An ideal BPA-free water bottle for gym, office, or travel. Join eco-friendly living today!"
  ```

Each output can be tweaked or combined as needed for your product page.

## Common mistakes

- **Too generic input:** If your feature list is vague ("good quality material"), the AI will produce vague copy. Provide specific details (e.g., "16oz stainless steel, sweat-proof finish").
- **Overly long descriptions:** Long AI drafts can overwhelm. Ask for shorter versions or break into bullet points if needed.
- **Ignoring brand voice:** AI defaults to generic tone. If your brand has a distinct voice, make sure to instruct the AI clearly (e.g., "quirky and playful tone").
- **Incorrect info:** AI might "hallucinate" details. Always verify that any number or spec (dimensions, battery life, etc.) is correct.

## Quality checklist

- All promised features and benefits are mentioned accurately.
- The description speaks to the target audience’s needs.
- Tone and style match your brand voice.
- The final text is free of errors (check grammar, spelling, factual accuracy).
- Includes a clear value proposition or call to action if appropriate.
