# Cooking Schedule Optimizer

## What You'll Accomplish

Not every night needs to be a cooking night. This workflow uses AI to help you **optimize when and how much to cook** throughout the week. You'll learn to batch cook on free days, plan quick meals on busy days, and create efficient cooking timelines for complex meals.

By the end, you'll have:
- A weekly cooking schedule that matches your availability.
- Strategies for efficient cooking sessions.
- Step-by-step timelines for multi-dish meals.

## Who This Is For

This is useful for:
- Anyone with inconsistent weekly schedules.
- Cooks who want to minimize time in the kitchen on busy days.
- People hosting dinners who need to coordinate multiple dishes.
- Meal preppers who want to optimize their big cooking sessions.

## Inputs You Need

- **Weekly schedule:** Which days are you busy vs. free?
- **Cooking capacity:** How long are you willing to cook on different days?
- **Meal complexity preferences:** Simple meals some days, more elaborate others?
- **Equipment available:** Oven, slow cooker, Instant Pot, etc.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Map Your Week
Identify which days you're time-rich (can cook 1+ hours) and which you're time-poor (15-20 minutes max).

### Step 2: Assign Cooking Intensity
- **Big cooking days:** Batch cook, prep for the week, make complex meals
- **Medium days:** Regular cooking, 30-45 minute meals
- **Easy days:** Leftovers, assembly meals, or minimal cooking

### Step 3: Ask AI to Build a Schedule
"Here's my week: Monday busy, Tuesday free, Wednesday very busy, Thursday normal, Friday fun night. Create a cooking schedule that maximizes Tuesday's free time to prep for the week."

### Step 4: Get Specific Timelines
For complex cooking sessions, ask for a minute-by-minute timeline. "I'm cooking a roast chicken with roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes for Sunday dinner. Give me a timeline so everything is ready at 6pm."

### Step 5: Execute the Plan
Follow your optimized schedule. Prep on big days, coast on busy days.

## Prompt Templates

- **Weekly schedule building:** "I have 3 hours to cook on Sunday but only 20 minutes on weeknights. Plan my week so Sunday's cooking carries me through the busy weekdays."
- **Multi-dish timeline:** "I'm making lasagna, garlic bread, and Caesar salad for a dinner party at 7pm. Create a timeline starting from 4pm showing when to do each step."
- **Instant Pot optimization:** "I have an Instant Pot and a regular oven. How can I cook a protein in the Instant Pot while roasting vegetables in the oven simultaneously?"
- **Leftover integration:** "If I cook a big pot of chili on Sunday, and roast chicken on Tuesday, plan how these can feed me through Friday with minimal additional cooking."

## Example Output

**Weekly Cooking Schedule:**

| Day | Cooking Time | Cooking Plan |
|-----|-------------|--------------|
| **Sunday** | 2.5 hours | Big prep: Roast chicken, prep grain salad, make soup for the week |
| **Monday** | 15 min | Leftover chicken + premade soup |
| **Tuesday** | 30 min | Stir-fry (uses quick-cooking ingredients) |
| **Wednesday** | 10 min | Grain salad from Sunday + rotisserie chicken |
| **Thursday** | 45 min | Fresh cooking: Pasta with vegetables |
| **Friday** | 0 min | Takeout or dinner out |
| **Saturday** | 1 hour | Fun cooking: Try a new recipe |

**Sunday Prep Timeline (2.5 hours):**
- 0:00 – Season chicken, start roasting (1 hour cook time)
- 0:15 – Start soup on stovetop (simmer 45 min)
- 0:30 – Cook grains for grain salad (20 min)
- 0:50 – Prep grain salad vegetables while grains cook
- 1:00 – Chicken done – rest while finishing salad
- 1:15 – Assemble grain salad, store for the week
- 1:30 – Soup done – portion and store
- 1:45 – Carve chicken, store portions
- 2:00 – Clean up

## Common Mistakes

- **Overestimating free time:** You think you have 2 hours but really only have 1. **Fix:** Be realistic and add buffer.
- **Underusing leftover potential:** Cooking fresh every day when you could coast on prep. **Fix:** Plan for intentional leftovers.
- **No timeline for complex meals:** Winging it leads to cold side dishes. **Fix:** Get a timeline from AI.
- **Ignoring equipment limitations:** Can't roast and bake at different temps simultaneously. **Fix:** Sequence dishes or use different appliances.
