# Grocery Substitution Workflow

## What You'll Accomplish

Ran out of an ingredient mid-recipe? Need to swap something for dietary reasons? This workflow shows you how to use AI to find the **best ingredient substitutes** on the fly, so you can keep cooking without a grocery run.

By the end, you'll know how to:
- Find appropriate substitutes for common missing ingredients.
- Make allergy-friendly swaps without ruining the dish.
- Adjust recipes based on what you have.

## Who This Is For

This is helpful for:
- Home cooks who often start cooking before checking all ingredients.
- Anyone cooking for people with food allergies or dietary restrictions.
- Budget-conscious cooks substituting expensive ingredients.
- Creative cooks who want to experiment with alternatives.

## Inputs You Need

- **The missing ingredient:** What don't you have?
- **Its role in the recipe:** Is it for flavor, structure, moisture, etc.?
- **What you have available:** What's in your kitchen that might work?
- **Any dietary restrictions:** The substitute needs to work for everyone eating.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Missing Ingredient
What's the recipe calling for that you don't have or can't use?

### Step 2: Understand Its Role
Is it for leavening (baking soda), creaminess (butter), acidity (lemon), etc.? Understanding the function helps find a good swap.

### Step 3: Ask AI for Substitutes
"My recipe calls for buttermilk but I don't have any. What can I substitute? I have regular milk and various other dairy products."

### Step 4: Evaluate the Options
AI might give several options. Consider what you have, what's closest in function, and any taste differences.

### Step 5: Adjust Quantities if Needed
Some substitutes aren't 1:1. Ask AI for the right proportions.

### Step 6: Test and Taste
Substitutes may slightly change the result. Taste as you go and adjust seasoning.

## Prompt Templates

- **Basic substitution:** "I'm making pancakes but don't have buttermilk. What can I substitute using regular milk and pantry items?"
- **Allergy swap:** "I need to replace eggs in a cake recipe due to an egg allergy. What are the best vegan egg substitutes for baking?"
- **Out of a key ingredient:** "My stir-fry recipe calls for soy sauce but I'm out. What's a good substitute that's similar in flavor?"
- **Healthy swap:** "I want to make mashed potatoes healthier. Can I substitute half the potatoes with cauliflower? How should I adjust?"
- **Multiple swaps:** "I'm making a recipe that calls for heavy cream and butter, but I want to make it dairy-free. What should I use instead of each?"

## Example Output

**Question:** "I'm making banana bread but I'm out of eggs. What can I use instead?"

**AI Response:**
For banana bread, you can substitute each egg with one of these:
1. **Flax egg:** 1 tbsp ground flaxseed + 3 tbsp water, let sit 5 min. *Best for moist, dense breads.*
2. **Chia egg:** 1 tbsp chia seeds + 3 tbsp water, let sit 5 min. *Similar to flax.*
3. **Mashed banana:** 1/4 cup extra banana per egg. *Works great in banana bread – you already have bananas!*
4. **Applesauce:** 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce per egg. *Adds moisture and sweetness.*
5. **Commercial egg replacer:** Follow package directions.

*Recommendation:* Since you're making banana bread, extra mashed banana is the easiest swap and enhances the banana flavor.

## Common Substitutions Quick Reference

| Missing | Substitute |
|---------|-----------|
| Buttermilk (1 cup) | 1 cup milk + 1 tbsp lemon juice or vinegar, let sit 5 min |
| Eggs (baking) | 1/4 cup applesauce, mashed banana, or flax egg |
| Butter | Coconut oil, vegetable oil, or margarine |
| Heavy cream | Coconut cream or cashew cream (dairy-free) |
| Soy sauce | Coconut aminos or tamari (gluten-free) |
| Breadcrumbs | Crushed crackers, oats, or almond flour |
| Fresh herbs | 1/3 amount of dried herbs |

## Common Mistakes

- **Ignoring the ingredient's role:** Substituting baking soda for baking powder without adjusting (they work differently). **Fix:** Understand function first.
- **Wrong proportions:** Using 1:1 when the substitute requires different amounts. **Fix:** Always ask for or look up correct ratios.
- **Flavor mismatches:** Coconut oil in a dish where coconut flavor doesn't work. **Fix:** Consider flavor impact.
- **Not testing:** Major recipe changes without tasting. **Fix:** Taste as you go.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] You understand why the ingredient is in the recipe.
- [ ] The substitute performs the same function.
- [ ] Proportions are adjusted correctly.
- [ ] Dietary restrictions are still respected with the substitute.
- [ ] You've considered flavor and texture impact.
