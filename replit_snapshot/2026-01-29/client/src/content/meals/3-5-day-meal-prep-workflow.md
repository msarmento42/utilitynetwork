# 3–5 Day Meal Prep Workflow

## What You'll Accomplish

Meal prepping is a game-changer for busy schedules. In this workflow, you'll use AI to plan and execute a batch cooking session that provides ready-to-eat meals for **3–5 days**. You'll learn which dishes store well, how to organize your prep day, and get safe storage and reheating guidance.

By the end, you'll have:
- A meal prep plan with recipes suited for make-ahead storage.
- A cooking timeline for your prep day.
- Storage and reheating instructions for each dish.

## Who This Is For

This workflow is perfect for:
- Busy professionals who want grab-and-go lunches and dinners.
- Anyone who hates cooking every single day.
- People trying to eat healthier by having planned meals ready.
- Those who want to save time during the workweek.

## Inputs You Need

- **Number of meals:** How many servings do you need? (e.g., 5 lunches and 5 dinners)
- **Storage capacity:** Consider your fridge and container space.
- **Dietary preferences:** What foods do you enjoy and can eat repeatedly?
- **Prep day availability:** How many hours can you dedicate to cooking?
- **Equipment:** Slow cooker, instant pot, sheet pans – what do you have?

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Decide What to Prep
Choose dishes that store and reheat well: grains, roasted vegetables, proteins, soups, and stews. Avoid dishes that get soggy (like dressed salads).

### Step 2: Ask AI for Meal Prep Ideas
"Suggest 3 meals I can batch cook on Sunday that will keep well in the fridge for 5 days. I want variety – one grain bowl, one soup, and one protein with vegetables."

### Step 3: Get a Grocery List
Request all ingredients needed for your prep session.

### Step 4: Create a Cooking Timeline
Ask AI to sequence your cooking. "I have 3 hours to prep. Create a timeline showing when to start each dish so everything is done efficiently."

### Step 5: Prep and Cook
Follow your timeline. Start with items that take longest (roasting, slow cooking) first.

### Step 6: Portion and Store
Divide meals into individual containers. Label with contents and date.

### Step 7: Get Storage and Reheating Instructions
Ask AI for guidance on how long each dish keeps and the best way to reheat it.

## Prompt Templates

- **Basic meal prep:** "I want to prep meals for 5 weekday lunches. Suggest 2-3 dishes that store well, give me recipes, and a shopping list."
- **With timeline:** "Plan a 3-hour Sunday meal prep session for the week. I want to make grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and a grain. Give me a minute-by-minute schedule."
- **Variety focus:** "Create a meal prep plan with 3 different proteins (chicken, beef, beans) and matching sides that I can mix and match throughout the week."
- **Storage guidance:** "How long can I safely store cooked chicken and roasted vegetables in the fridge? What's the best way to reheat them?"

## Example Output

**Meal Prep Plan (Sunday, 3 hours):**

**Dish 1:** Grilled Chicken Breasts (4 servings)

- 0:05 – Marinate chicken
- 0:15 – Prep vegetables, start roasting (35 min)
- 0:20 – Start cooking quinoa (15 min)

## Common Mistakes

- **Choosing foods that don't store well:** Crispy foods, dressed salads, and cut avocado don't last. **Fix:** Stick to hearty dishes.
- **Not cooling before storing:** Hot food in containers can create bacteria. **Fix:** Let food cool to room temperature before refrigerating.
- **Overpacking the fridge:** Air circulation matters. **Fix:** Don't stack containers too tightly.
- **Forgetting to label:** You'll forget what's what. **Fix:** Label with contents and date.

## Disclaimer

Follow proper food safety guidelines. Store cooked food in the refrigerator within 2 hours of cooking. Most cooked meals keep 3-5 days refrigerated. When in doubt, throw it out. Reheat food to 165°F (74°C) before eating. This is general guidance, not food safety certification.
