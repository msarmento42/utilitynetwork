# Family Logistics & Picky Eater Planner

## What You'll Accomplish

Feeding a family is complicated: different schedules, different tastes, and different dietary needs. This workflow shows you how to use AI to create a **unified meal plan** that accommodates everyone – picky eaters included – without becoming a short-order cook.

By the end, you'll have:
- A weekly meal plan that works for everyone's schedule.
- Strategies for adapting meals for different preferences.
- Ideas for making one base meal with variations for picky eaters.

## Who This Is For

This is essential for:
- Parents with picky children.
- Families with members who have different dietary restrictions.
- Households where people eat at different times.
- Anyone tired of making multiple dinners every night.

## Inputs You Need

- **Family members and their preferences:** Who's eating, and what do they like/dislike?
- **Dietary restrictions:** Allergies, vegetarian members, etc.
- **Schedule constraints:** Who eats when? Early dinners for kids, late for adults?
- **Non-negotiables:** What foods will absolutely not be eaten by whom?

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Map Out Preferences
Create a simple profile for each family member. Example: "Kid 1: no vegetables except corn and carrots. Kid 2: vegetarian. Adult 1: loves spicy food. Adult 2: gluten-free."

### Step 2: Share with AI
"Help me plan a week of dinners for a family of 4. One child doesn't eat vegetables, one is vegetarian, one adult is gluten-free, and one loves spicy food."

### Step 3: Request Adaptable Meals
Ask for meals that can be customized. "Suggest dinners where the base works for everyone but toppings or sides can be customized."

### Step 4: Consider Timing
If schedules differ, ask for meals that hold well or can be served in stages.

### Step 5: Get Build-Your-Own Ideas
Taco bars, rice bowls, and DIY pizzas let everyone customize their plate.

### Step 6: Plan Make-Ahead Components
For really busy nights, prep components that can be assembled quickly for whoever's home.

## Prompt Templates

- **Preference mapping:** "My family has these preferences: [list each person]. Suggest 5 dinner ideas where everyone can eat the same base meal with minor modifications."
- **Picky eater focus:** "My 5-year-old only eats plain pasta, chicken nuggets, and cheese. How can I make family dinners that include something he'll eat while we have more variety?"
- **Schedule juggling:** "We eat dinner in shifts – kids at 5:30, adults at 7:30. Suggest meals that can be served twice without drying out or losing quality."
- **Build-your-own dinners:** "Give me 5 'build your own' dinner ideas (like taco bar) where each person can customize their plate."

## Example Output

**Family Profile:**
- Parent 1: Loves everything, trying to eat healthier
- Parent 2: Gluten-free
- Child 1 (8yo): Picky – only likes plain proteins, cheese, basic carbs
- Child 2 (12yo): Adventurous eater but no spicy food

**Adaptable Dinner Plan:**

**Monday:** Taco Bar
- Base: ground beef seasoned mild
- Toppings: cheese, lettuce, tomato, salsa (spicy for adults), sour cream
- Gluten-free: corn tortillas available
- Picky child: plain beef and cheese in a tortilla

**Tuesday:** Rice Bowls
- Base: white rice + grilled chicken
- Toppings: stir-fry vegetables, teriyaki sauce, sriracha (adults)
- Picky child: plain rice and chicken with cheese on top

**Wednesday:** Pasta Night
- Gluten-free pasta for one pot, regular for another
- Base: marinara sauce with options to add meatballs
- Picky child: butter pasta with parmesan

**Thursday:** Build-Your-Own Pizzas
- Pre-made crusts (regular and gluten-free)
- Everyone picks their toppings
- Picky child: cheese only

**Friday:** Grilled Chicken + Sides
- Plain grilled chicken for everyone
- Sides: roasted vegetables (adults), corn and rice (kids)
- Easy to serve in shifts

## Common Mistakes

- **Making completely separate meals:** Exhausting. **Fix:** Find adaptable base meals.
- **Forcing picky eaters:** Creates battles. **Fix:** Always include one thing they'll eat, no pressure.
- **Ignoring the picky eater entirely:** They won't eat. **Fix:** Plan with them in mind.
- **Overcomplicating:** Too many variations. **Fix:** Limit customizations to 2-3 options.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Dietary restrictions are respected.
- [ ] Meals are adaptable without being separate dinners.
