# Budget Grocery List Builder

## What You'll Accomplish

Eating well on a budget is easier when you have a clear plan. In this workflow, you'll use AI to create a **budget-friendly grocery list** along with meal ideas, so you can feed yourself or your family without overspending. The AI will help identify cost-effective recipes and ingredients, then output a shopping list that fits your specified budget.

By the end, you'll have:
- A set of meal suggestions that emphasize affordable ingredients.
- An organized grocery list optimized for low-cost items.
- Rough cost estimates for your groceries, to help you stay **within budget**.

## Who This Is For

This is ideal for:
- **Students or families on a tight budget** who need to plan meals and shopping carefully.
- Anyone trying to save money on groceries by planning ahead and avoiding impulse buys.
- When you're between paychecks or after an expensive month and need to **trim the food budget**.
- If you want to see how far a certain amount (say $50 or $100) can stretch for meals.

## Inputs You Need

Be ready to provide:
- **Budget amount:** The total you can spend (e.g., $75 for the week's groceries).
- **Meal timeframe and count:** How many meals (and for how many people) the groceries should cover.
- **Basic pantry items:** List what staples you already have (spices, oil, rice, etc.) so the AI doesn't include them in the budget.
- **Dietary preferences:** Vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.
- **Store preferences (optional):** If you shop at a specific store known for low prices, mention it.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Set Your Budget
Tell the AI your budget upfront. Example: "I have $60 to spend on groceries for this week."

### Step 2: Describe Your Needs
Specify how many meals, for how many people, and any dietary requirements.

### Step 3: Request Budget-Friendly Meal Ideas
Ask the AI to suggest meals using affordable ingredients. Example: "Suggest 5 dinner ideas that are cheap to make – things like beans, rice, pasta, eggs, and seasonal vegetables."

### Step 4: Ask for Cost Estimates
Have the AI estimate costs for each meal or the total grocery list. This helps you see if you're on track.

### Step 5: Get an Organized Grocery List
Request a list grouped by store section with estimated costs per item or per meal.

### Step 6: Review and Adjust
If the total exceeds your budget, ask AI to swap out expensive items for cheaper alternatives.

### Step 7: Finalize and Shop
Once the list fits your budget, you're ready to shop confidently.

## Prompt Templates

- **Basic budget plan:** "Create a grocery list and meal plan for $50 that covers 5 dinners for 2 people. Focus on cheap staples like rice, beans, eggs, and seasonal produce."
- **Family budget:** "Plan a week of dinners for a family of 4 on a $100 budget. Include estimated costs and prioritize affordable proteins like chicken thighs and ground turkey."
- **Stretch the dollar:** "I only have $30 for groceries this week. What meals can I make that are filling and nutritious? Give me a grocery list with estimated prices."
- **Store-specific:** "Create a grocery list for Aldi or Lidl that stays under $75 for a week of meals for 3 people."

## Example Output

**Budget: $60 for 5 dinners (2 people)**

**Meal 1:** Bean and Rice Burrito Bowls (~$6)
- Canned black beans, rice, salsa, cheese, onion

**Meal 2:** Pasta Primavera (~$8)
- Pasta, frozen mixed vegetables, olive oil, parmesan

**Meal 3:** Egg Fried Rice (~$5)
- Eggs, rice, frozen peas, soy sauce, green onions

**Meal 4:** Lentil Soup (~$7)
- Lentils, canned tomatoes, carrots, onion, spices

**Meal 5:** Chicken Thighs with Roasted Vegetables (~$12)
- Chicken thighs, potatoes, carrots, onion

**Estimated Total: ~$38** (leaving room for bread, milk, or snacks)

## Common Mistakes

- **Not accounting for items you already have:** You might buy duplicates. **Fix:** Tell AI what's already in your pantry.
- **Unrealistic budget for the scope:** Trying to feed a family of 5 for $20 might not work. **Fix:** Be realistic or reduce meal count.
- **Ignoring sales and seasons:** AI doesn't know current prices. **Fix:** Check store flyers and adjust the list.
- **Only focusing on cheap, not nutritious:** **Fix:** Ask for balanced meals with protein, vegetables, and grains.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Total estimated cost is within budget.
- [ ] Meals are nutritionally balanced (protein, vegetables, grains).
- [ ] Grocery list doesn't duplicate items you already have.
- [ ] Recipes are practical and familiar enough to cook.
- [ ] Estimated prices seem reasonable for your area.
