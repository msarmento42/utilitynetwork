# Pantry-First Meal Planning Workflow

## What You'll Accomplish

If you've ever stared at a pantry full of food and still felt like there's "nothing to cook," this workflow is for you. **Pantry-first meal planning** flips the script: instead of picking recipes then buying ingredients, you'll start with what you already have. By the end of this process, you'll have a meal plan (and grocery list) that maximizes the use of your on-hand ingredients – reducing grocery bills and preventing food waste.

**What you get:** A set of meals for the next few days that creatively incorporate the canned goods, produce, and staples you've already stockpiled, plus a short shopping list of only the missing items needed to complete those recipes.

## Who This Is For

Use this when you want to **save money or avoid waste**. It's great for:
- End-of-week planning, when you want to clear out remaining ingredients before they spoil.
- Before a grocery trip: plan meals from your pantry so you only buy what's necessary.
- Anyone on a budget – you'll naturally spend less by using what you have first.
- Cooks who accumulate a lot of staples or leftovers and need inspiration to use them up.

If you find yourself with random ingredients and no clear plan, or you're challenging yourself to a "pantry challenge" week (minimal shopping), this workflow will help you turn those odds and ends into dinner.

## Inputs You Need

Gather this information to give the AI:
- **Inventory of ingredients:** Take note of the main items you have. Focus on proteins (e.g., a can of chickpeas, some ground beef in the freezer), produce (3 carrots, half a broccoli, etc.), and useful staples (like pasta, rice, canned tomatoes, spices).
- **Must-use items:** If something is about to expire or you're determined to use a particular item ("use that open jar of salsa"), highlight those to the AI.
- **Number of meals:** Decide how many meals you want to plan out of what you have.
- **Dietary preferences:** Note any usual preferences or restrictions.
- **Additional groceries limit:** (Optional) If you're on a budget, specify you only want to buy at most a few additional ingredients.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: List What You Have
Start by telling the AI something like, "I want to plan meals using what I already have." Then list your available ingredients. For example: "I have 2 bell peppers, a can of black beans, half a carton of mushrooms, eggs, and plenty of rice and spices."

### Step 2: State What You Want to Achieve
For instance, "Help me make dinners for the next 3 days from these ingredients." Include any must-use item ("the mushrooms are about to go bad, so use those in the first meal") and constraints ("I'd prefer vegetarian meals").

### Step 3: Ask for Recipe Suggestions
Let the AI propose meal ideas or recipes that use these items. It might come back with suggestions like a veggie stir-fry, a hearty bean chili, or a mushroom omelette, depending on your list.

### Step 4: Refine if Needed
If the AI suggests something impractical (like a bake that requires ingredients you don't have), respond with feedback. For example: "I don't have any milk for that soup, can you suggest a different recipe or a substitution for milk?"

### Step 5: Request a Shopping List
Once the meal ideas look good, ask the AI to compile a grocery list that *only includes items you're missing*.

### Step 6: Review the Plan
Double-check that each suggested meal indeed uses your pantry items. If something you wanted to use is missing, you can prompt: "Can we also incorporate the canned tomatoes I have?"

### Step 7: Finalize the Plan and List
Confirm the recipes and note down the final shopping list of just a few items (if any).

## Prompt Templates

- **Basic inventory prompt:** "I want to plan 4 dinners using mostly what's in my pantry. I have chicken thighs, a box of pasta, canned tomatoes, a bag of spinach, and various spices. I'm open to buying 1–2 extra ingredients if needed. What meals can I make over the next few days with these?"
- **Must-use emphasis:** "Help me use up specific items: I have a lot of carrots and a half container of cream that expires soon. Propose a couple of dinner ideas that would use these up, plus other ingredients I have."
- **Vegetarian pantry plan:** "I have pantry staples (rice, beans, lentils, canned tomatoes) and some veggies (potatoes, spinach, carrots). Create a 3-day vegetarian dinner plan using these items."
- **Leftover remix:** "I cooked a big batch of roast beef yesterday, and I have leftover cooked beef and roasted veggies. Suggest two new dinner ideas to make with these leftovers."
- **Minimal grocery challenge:** "Plan dinners for the next 5 nights by mostly 'shopping' from my pantry. I have [list items]. I only want to spend $20 on additional groceries."

## Example Output

**Meal Plan:**

**Day 1:** Creamy Chicken Pasta – Use your chicken thighs, pasta, and canned tomatoes to make a creamy tomato pasta. *Additional needed:* maybe just some cheese or herbs if not on hand.

**Day 2:** Vegetable Curry – A curry with lentils (from your pantry), carrots, and spinach. *Uses:* canned tomatoes and spices you have. *Additional needed:* coconut milk if you don't have it.

**Day 3:** Roast Beef Tacos – Shred the leftover roast beef and serve in tacos. *Uses:* your roasted veggies and spices. *Additional needed:* small pack of tortillas and an avocado (optional).

**Minimal Grocery List:**
- Coconut milk (1 can) – for the curry
- Cheese (Parmesan or mozzarella) – for the pasta
- Tortillas (1 package) – for beef tacos
- Avocado – for topping tacos (optional)

## Common Mistakes

- **Incomplete inventory:** If you forget to mention some ingredients you have, the AI can't use them. **Fix:** Give a thorough list of main items.
- **Unwanted extra purchases:** Sometimes the AI might lean on an ingredient you don't have. **Fix:** Be clear about minimizing new ingredients.
- **Recipes too simple or repetitive:** **Fix:** Prompt for variety or specify cuisines.
- **Overlooking spoilage timelines:** **Fix:** If an item will spoil sooner, ask AI to use that in an earlier meal.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Uses key ingredients you wanted to utilize (especially anything expiring soon).
- [ ] Minimal new items on the shopping list.
- [ ] Feasible recipes you know how to cook or are willing to try.
- [ ] No forgotten item from your pantry list.
- [ ] Plan to use perishable fresh ingredients early in the timeline.
