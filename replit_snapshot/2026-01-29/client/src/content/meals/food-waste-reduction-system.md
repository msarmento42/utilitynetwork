# Food Waste Reduction System

## What You'll Accomplish

Food waste is expensive and environmentally harmful. This workflow helps you use AI to **minimize food waste** by incorporating leftovers, nearly-expired items, and odds and ends into your meal plan. The goal: use what you buy before it goes bad.

By the end, you'll have:
- A system for tracking what needs to be used soon.
- Meal ideas that incorporate items before they spoil.
- Less food in the trash and more money in your pocket.

## Who This Is For

This is valuable for:
- Anyone who regularly throws away spoiled food.
- Budget-conscious shoppers who hate wasting money.
- Environmentally-minded cooks wanting to reduce waste.
- People who overbuy at the grocery store.

## Inputs You Need

- **What's in your fridge/pantry:** Especially items approaching expiration.
- **Use-by dates:** Which items need to be used first?
- **Meal count:** How many meals do you need to plan?
- **Flexibility:** Are you willing to try new recipes to use things up?

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Take Inventory
Check your fridge, freezer, and pantry. Note items that are close to expiration or have been there a while.

### Step 2: Prioritize by Urgency
List items in order of "needs to be used first." Fresh produce and dairy typically top the list.

### Step 3: Ask AI for Ideas
"I have these items that need to be used this week: [list]. Give me dinner ideas that will use them up before they spoil."

### Step 4: Plan Strategically
Schedule meals so the most perishable items are used first.

### Step 5: Get Creative with Leftovers
Instead of reheating the same thing, ask AI for transformation ideas. "I have leftover roasted vegetables. What new dish can I make with them?"

### Step 6: Make It a Weekly Habit
Each week, do a quick fridge check before meal planning. Build "use it up" meals into your rotation.

## Prompt Templates

- **Use-it-up planning:** "I have wilting spinach, half an onion, 3 eggs, and leftover rice. What quick meal can I make that uses all of these?"
- **About-to-expire dairy:** "My sour cream expires tomorrow and I have about 1 cup left. What recipes use sour cream as a main ingredient?"
- **Leftover transformation:** "I have 2 cups of leftover pasta with marinara. How can I transform this into a different meal?"
- **Freezer clean-out:** "I have frozen chicken breasts from 3 months ago, frozen vegetables, and frozen berries. Plan 3 meals using these freezer items."
- **Weekly waste prevention:** "Before I meal plan this week, here's what I have that needs using: [list]. Incorporate these into my dinner plan."

## Example Output

**Items to Use:**
- Half bunch of wilting kale
- Leftover cooked rice (2 cups)
- Can of chickpeas (been in pantry forever)
- Yogurt expiring in 2 days
- Lemons starting to dry out

**AI-Generated Use-It-Up Plan:**

**Day 1:** Kale and Chickpea Curry (uses kale, chickpeas, and some yogurt for a cooling side)

**Day 2:** Fried Rice (uses leftover rice, any vegetables)

**Day 3:** Lemon Yogurt Chicken (uses yogurt as marinade, lemon for flavor)

**Bonus:** Make lemon zest before lemons go bad – freeze for later use

## Common Mistakes

- **Not checking expiration dates:** Things spoil before you notice. **Fix:** Weekly fridge audit.
- **Planning meals then checking inventory:** You buy new instead of using old. **Fix:** Check inventory first.
- **Afraid to experiment:** Weird ingredient combos seem off. **Fix:** Let AI suggest creative uses.
- **Forgetting the freezer:** Things hide and get freezer burn. **Fix:** Include freezer in your inventory check.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Perishable items are used before they spoil.
- [ ] Meal plan incorporates items from your "use soon" list.
- [ ] Leftovers have a plan (transformation or intentional reuse).
- [ ] Freezer is checked and rotated.
- [ ] Less food ends up in the trash each week.

## Disclaimer

Always use your judgment about food safety. When in doubt about whether something has spoiled, throw it out. "Use-by" and "best-by" dates are guidelines – use your senses (smell, appearance, texture) to assess freshness. This workflow is about reducing unnecessary waste, not eating unsafe food.
