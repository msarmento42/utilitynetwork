*Note:* While these workflows show how AI can assist with meal ideas and planning, always apply your own judgment. Double-check AI-generated recipes for ingredients you or your family can't have (allergies, etc.), and follow food safety practices when cooking. Think of AI as a helpful kitchen assistant – you're still the chef in charge!

Happy cooking, and enjoy the extra free time and peace of mind that smart meal planning can bring!
