# Recipe Rotation Tracker

## What You'll Accomplish

Do you have favorite recipes you love but forget about? Or find yourself making the same three meals on repeat? This workflow helps you create a **recipe rotation system** using AI – a way to track your go-to recipes and schedule them so you get variety without decision fatigue.

By the end, you'll have:
- A catalog of your family's favorite recipes.
- A rotation schedule so meals repeat at sensible intervals.
- Less "what should we have tonight?" stress.

## Who This Is For

This is perfect for:
- Anyone who's tired of making the same things over and over.
- Families with favorite meals they want to keep in regular rotation.
- Cooks who have lots of recipes saved but forget to use them.
- People who want meal planning to feel automatic.

## Inputs You Need

- **Your recipe collection:** List your family's favorite meals (10-20 is a good start).
- **Rotation preferences:** How often should meals repeat? (Weekly? Every 2 weeks?)
- **Dietary variety goals:** Want to ensure one vegetarian meal per week? One fish dish?
- **Seasonal considerations:** Are some dishes better in certain seasons?

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: List Your Favorite Recipes
Write down all the dinners your family enjoys. Include quick weeknight meals and special occasion dishes.

### Step 2: Categorize Your Recipes
Group by: protein (chicken, beef, vegetarian, fish), cuisine (Italian, Mexican, Asian), or complexity (quick, moderate, project meal).

### Step 3: Ask AI to Create a Rotation
"I have these 15 favorite recipes [list them]. Create a 3-week dinner rotation that includes variety and doesn't repeat any meal within 2 weeks."

### Step 4: Add Rules for Variety
"Make sure each week has at least one vegetarian meal, no more than 2 chicken dishes, and includes at least one 30-minute meal on a weeknight."

### Step 5: Review and Adjust
Check the rotation. Does it account for your busy nights? Swap in quick meals where needed.

### Step 6: Use the Rotation
Follow the schedule. When week 3 ends, start over or ask AI to refresh the rotation.

## Prompt Templates

- **Basic rotation:** "Here are my family's 12 favorite dinners: [list]. Create a 2-week rotation schedule that doesn't repeat any meal within the 2 weeks."
- **With variety rules:** "Create a monthly dinner rotation using these 20 recipes [list]. Include at least 1 fish, 1 pasta, 2 vegetarian meals each week. Distribute chicken and beef evenly."
- **Seasonal adjustment:** "I have winter-friendly recipes (stews, roasts) and summer recipes (grilled, salads). Create a rotation for winter months using only the winter-appropriate dishes."
- **Refresh request:** "We've been using this rotation for 2 months [show current schedule]. Suggest changes to keep things fresh without adding new recipes."

## Example Output

**3-Week Dinner Rotation (Family of 4):**

| Week | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1 | Taco Night | Pasta Primavera | Grilled Chicken | Bean Soup | Pizza Night | Steak | Roast Chicken |
| 2 | Stir-Fry | Spaghetti & Meatballs | Fish Tacos | Veggie Curry | Burgers | Salmon | Slow Cooker Chili |
| 3 | Chicken Fajitas | Veggie Fried Rice | BBQ Chicken | Lentil Soup | Mac & Cheese | Lamb Chops | Pot Roast |

*Quick meals (under 30 min) scheduled for Mon-Thu. More involved dishes on weekends.*

## Common Mistakes

- **Too few recipes in rotation:** You'll still feel repetitive. **Fix:** Aim for at least 14-21 recipes for 2-3 week rotation.
- **Ignoring schedule realities:** Complex meals on busy weeknights. **Fix:** Tag recipes by prep time and assign appropriately.
- **Never updating the rotation:** Gets stale. **Fix:** Refresh quarterly or swap in new favorites.
- **Rigid adherence:** Life happens. **Fix:** Treat the rotation as a guideline, not a rule.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] All family favorites are included in the rotation.
- [ ] Meals don't repeat too frequently.
- [ ] Variety exists (proteins, cuisines, preparation methods).
- [ ] Quick meals are scheduled on busy days.
- [ ] The rotation is sustainable and enjoyable.
